VMost reviews will tell you what's so great about this movie and why it's worth watching, but I figured you should hear the other side of the story.\u000a\u000aFirst of all a small note for Tolkien fans. If you thought An Unexpected Journey strayed a bit too far from the book: The Desolation of Smaug looks like the script writers didn't even know there was a book. The movie tries hard to change the story wherever it can, reducing fan-favorite chapters to 5 minute scenes and writing new content that feels out of place.\u000a\u000aBut it's not only bad if you've read the book. I really wonder what the target audience is, because it feels like it's written for 15 year old boys. There are random action scenes every 10 minutes and 'funny' decapitations every 30. The worst thing here is that the action comes at the cost of character development. You have a band of 13 Dwarfs and a Hobbit, yet you rarely see them interact.\u000a\u000aNow I like Elves more than Dwarfs, so I didn't mind seeing so much of them in this movie. But having them show up in every place to save the day feels wrong. Perhaps Peter Jackson thought his cast of Dwarfs wasn't good enough to create an enjoyable movie? Gandalf's scenes in Dol Guldur were an interesting addition in concept, but they are just too slow. I feel his scenes mostly serve as an attempt to raise The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings' level of epicness. And that just doesn't work.\u000a\u000aThe story is full of illogicalities. How does entering the mountain to steal the Arkenstone to unite the Dwarfs to kill the Dragon to enter the mountain work exactly?? And remember that heartwarming last scene of An Unexpected Journey, where Thorin finally accepts Bilbo? Well, that's all gone again. Even though he keeps outsmarting all the Dwarfs, Bilbo is back to being an unappreciated 5th wheel of the party. And did the writers really think viewers would be so desperate for a love story that they'd enjoy an Elf and a Dwarf flirting it up? Their scenes feel forced and are painful to watch.\u000a\u000aMartin Freeman's acting is top notch again, but sadly he hardly gets any screen time. He only shines in his scene with Smaug. Now Smaug as a character is awesome, no complaints there. Yet most of his scenes are way too dragged out. There's a 20 minute scene with the Dwarfs running around thinking they can defeat him. Only at that point the movie already hinted at the only possible way of defeating him. Perhaps the worst aspect is that these scenes make Smaug look like an unintelligent creature. Dwarfs luring a Dragon around by going "Nana-nanana you can't catch me!" is not only silly and cliché, it's an insult to Smaug's character.\u000a\u000aFinal complaint: the whole movie builds up to a scene.... that's apparently going to be the opening scene of movie 3. Nobody in the cinema was sure if the movie had ended, or there was just an awkwardly long pause when the screen went black.\u000a\u000aA movie like this you'll want to see, no matter how good or bad it is. You can't miss out on such a huge release, especially when it looks gorgeous in HFR 3D. But where I watched each Lord of the Rings movie 3 times in cinema, watching The Desolation of Smaug just once was enough for me.\u000a\u000aIn the end, most problems of the movie seem to stem from the decision to turn the cute Hobbit tale into three epic movies that have to live up to the Lord of the Rings hype. It doesn't work.

VI won't "review" the content of the movie in any detail, but provide some thoughts about how this film should be approached. I consider myself a Tolkienist (in fact I saw this movie on opening night because I secured a promotion deal with the local cinema: I spent four hours until midnight writing people's names in Elvish writing!) It is to be expected that many fans of of the original book will perceive this movie as a bloated, garbled monster version of the written story they loved. It is important to realize, before going in, that this is not simply "the movie of the book". This is Jackson's The Hobbit, not Tolkien's, and they are best appreciated as independent works. They represent different media, come from different centuries, and have partly different target audiences. The children's book was written before Tolkien had any idea of the grand trilogy to follow; Jackson had already produced his Lord of the Rings trilogy and somewhat understandably tries to make the prequels resemble it, in tone and scope.\u000a\u000aOne could argue that Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, when complete, will set up the LotR film trilogy far better than Tolkien's simple children's book sets up the literary LotR. (The change in tone from children's book to grand epic is VERY pronounced, even grating for those who try to read The Hobbit after finishing LotR.) Incidentally, Jackson's prequel trilogy apparently will not spoil the LotR trilogy the way the Star Wars prequels give away important plot points of the original movies. When finished, Jackson's six Middle-earth movies can be profitably watched in sequence of internal chronology.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, Jackson's Hobbit trilogy is "based on" the 1930s children's book in the sense that the characters have the same names and visit much the same places in somewhat the same order (though new characters and places are also added). Their basic motivations are also the same. But beyond that, one should not expect much "fidelity". There is hardly anything that isn't greatly embellished and vastly elaborated, mostly so as to allow for a FAR darker tone and MUCH more fantasy action (i.e., fights). The spiders of Mirkwood here approach actual horror, as compared to their rather more children-friendly literary counterparts (where we have Bilbo insulting them with silly "Attercop" rhymes).\u000a\u000aThe wizards' conflict with the Necromancer of Dol Guldur, which in the book happens entirely "offscreen" and is just briefly alluded to when Gandalf has returned near the end, is here actually shown. This is understandable; Gandalf would otherwise be completely absent for much of this movie. Also, Jackson's audience will already know that this is the start of the war with Sauron, and the all-important Dark Lord could not well be ignored. Tolkien in his letters noted how Sauron casts just "a fleeting shadow" over the pages of The Hobbit; in Jackson's movie the shadow is darker and deeper.\u000a\u000aEntire new subplots are freely created and added to the story. The Elf Tauriel and her unlikely infatuation with one of the Dwarfs is clearly meant to add a love story where the book has none, and have at least ONE strong female character (no concern of Tolkien's when he wrote a story for children in the 1930s).\u000a\u000aThe continued survival of ALL the protagonists despite their endless brushes with death doesn't just strain credibility -- it utterly and completely banishes and eliminates credibility. We are left with FANTASY action in the truest sense, to be enjoyed for choreography, not plausibility. If cats have nine lives, a Jacksonian Dwarf clearly enjoys a three-digit number of lives.\u000a\u000aSo, viewed as an independent work, is this a good movie? Technically it is nothing short of brilliant, full of detail that can only be appreciated on the big screen. Smaug is, hands down, the best-designed movie dragon the world has yet seen. If I were a teenager instead of a ripe old 42, this wealth of fantasy action would probably have exited me no end. It is nice to see Legolas again, even if he is not in the book. I liked the sequences with the amorphous Sauron. Poor Evangeline Lily would however look better without those silly ears, which are simply too big and look just as fake as they are. Also, I'm not sure the hinted-at Elf-Dwarf romance adds much to the story. All things considered, I'll award Jackson's re-imagined "The Hobbit" seven stars.\u000a\u000aThere were also seven stars in Durin's crown, for those of you who can understand the literary allusion ...

VI saw the movie in 2D because I hated the 3D HFR in the first Hobbit movie. I thought the HFR just made the movie sets look like sets instead of being part of the movie universe. I much preferred the 2D experience here and it was easier for me to try to immerse myself in the movie. Regrettably there were too many things that were wrong with the movie for me to achieve that. \u000a\u000aThis movie had a budget of something like 200 million dollars, over double that of any of the individual movies of the original trilogy. Where did all that money go? To that mostly horrid CGI? There was just bloody too much of it like in the first movie. Everything looks so damn fake with the CGI slammed front and center with no artistic attempt to hide its shortcomings. For example, when Legolas starts chasing Bolg out of Laketown, even his horse is made with CGI. Why? Couldn't you afford to rent one horse? The orcs were mostly made with CGI and they weren't menacing in the slightest. The few scenes with actual actors with makeup playing the orcs were far superior. Erebor looked quite good in general with its mountains of coins and treasures but the melted gold looked unbelievably bad. Many of the actual sets in the movie were very well done and I'm really puzzled why they didn't use them more. The CGI in LOTR looked far more convincing and epic, the large establishing shots looked like grand paintings come alive. What happened here? I don't get it. It felt like I was watching a video game and I don't want to feel that way when I'm watching a movie. Granted, the original trilogy did have a bit of silly looking CGI here and there but at least it was constantly grounded by real sets. \u000a\u000aThere was also some really weird editing here too. The movie is already way too long and they still include absolutely pointless scenes. For example, when Gandalf is climbing the stairs by the mountain and the ledge gives up, the movie suddenly cuts to a sweeping shot of the mountain side. Why not just stay with Gandalf, it would provide more intensity. There's many examples like this. In Mirkwood when Bilbo is snapping at the spider web they shouldn't zoom deep into the web with the camera. Stuff like this tells nothing and adds nothing to the film. This also takes time away from the character development. When one of the dwarfs oversleeps and misses the boat to Erebor, I couldn't even remember who he was and why I should care that he was stranded in Laketown. Also, the most puzzling and distracting choice in the movie was using that weird POV camera footage in the barrel scenes, it looked so utterly different that it took me out of the movie completely. \u000a\u000aThe action could've been cut down significantly too. There was no real context or meaning for most of it anyway. Also, after Legolas has killed his umpteenth orc in yet another physics-breaking and miraculous way, you simply lose interest. He can apparently do anything. My feeling is that in the original trilogy the "laws of physics" so to say were merely bent somewhat, here they're completely shattered. All of this may sound nitpicky but I'm essentially doing this because the movie didn't get me emotionally invested in it in a positive way at all.\u000a\u000aThe movie wasn't particularly funny either despite its lighthearted source material, I laughed much more heartily in many parts of the original trilogy. The Gimli joke was quite funny though. There was also absolutely no memorable music in this movie and none of it moved me like much of the music did in the original trilogy. I didn't get shivers at any point of the movie.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't all bad or mediocre though. Smaug was magnificent and Benedict Cumberbatch did a great job voice acting the dragon, definitely something to witness in a theater. Smaug's discussions with Bilbo were also great. Gandalf's venture into Dol Guldur was also interesting though that is mainly because Ian McKellen is such a fine actor that he can catch your attention with ease. The cameos by Peter Jackson in the beginning eating the carrot and by Stephen Colbert as the Laketown spy were fun even though I think they might've been too distracting had I loved the movie. The pacing in the movie is a bit of a mixed bag. The first movie had bad pacing because it was overly long without anything really happening. Desolation of Smaug swings the pendulum to the other end with endless action sequences pasted after another. Sure it's more exciting to watch but it was dearly missing some slower sequences to digest everything. \u000a\u000aI'm a massive fan of the original trilogy but the first two Hobbit movies simply haven't captured the epicness and magic of those movies at all. And if the Hobbit wasn't intended to feel epic, then why make it into three movies? There's also something else I don't get. The original movie trilogy adaptation established what the LOTR universe looked and felt like. Is the Hobbit trilogy still supposed to happen in that same universe? I didn't ever feel like anyone was in any serious danger because they survive crazier and crazier encounters after the next and because of that there's no tension. This wasn't the case with the originals. Huge spiders were very dangerous in LOTR, here Bilbo is just killing them off left and right. I just wish they'd taken much more liberties with the material and really placed this story into the grittier universe that was established by the original trilogy. Or maybe they should've done something completely different instead of trying to imitate the originals and coming short of them. Anything but this.

VThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is more of a bad Steven Seagal clone than an adaptation of well-read literature. The first film in the new trilogy, An Unexpected Journey, was very good, with one problem I'll mention later. If the worst decision Director Peter Jackson made was to include Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly, which seems to be the case for the professional praise-givers, this film would be fantastic. However, it just so happens that there's this little thing Jackson and his fellow writers forgot to do: make sure the movie resembles the book.\u000a\u000aI'm sure most people who saw the first movie remember the leading villain Azog. Well, in case you haven't read the book, page 251 of my 1997 Houghton Mifflin copy states "Bolg of the North is coming, O Dain! whose father you slew in Moria." In the section on Durin's Folk in Appendix A of the Lord of the Rings, it is stated that Dain Ironfoot, who is supposed to appear in the next film, slew Azog in the big Dwarf vs. Goblin battle we see as a flashback in film one. This means that the entire Azog subplot is just one big fan-fiction. It is one thing to include the son of the Elven-King (Legolas) even though he is not mentioned in the book, after all, is it so inconceivable that Legolas would be near his father? It is an entirely different matter when a character is included even though he has been dead for over 100 years!\u000a\u000aContinuing with our game of "What is timeline consistency?", we come across Gandalf. Gandalf ends movie 2 in a cage at Dol Guldur. Beyond the fact that there is no rationale for such a decision, we know from Appendix B that Gandalf reports the existence of Sauron to the White Council and then takes part in the attack on Dol Guldur. After that battle, he proceeds to save Bilbo's life right before the Battle of Five Armies. Based on this film's timeline and what part of the original timeline still remains, Gandalf has but a handful of days to accomplish all that I have listed.\u000a\u000aMy copy of The Hobbit is 271 pages long. The US edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is 310 pages. Why in the name of Eru do you need three movies for this story? I understand and would have gladly stood behind two films, therefore allowing for extended action sequences and a limited reduction in content. Three films should be more than enough to cover the entire book but apparently not for Peter Jackson. \u000a\u000aBeorn is trimmed down to the importance of Celeborn, then we watch a ridiculously long giant spider sequence, then the dwarfs are captured for maybe three hours Middle-Earth time, then we watch an overly long fan-fiction chapter about Azog's friends being killed by our two elf heroes. Note that Bolg is able to attack the dwarfs because Jackson changed the escape from Mirkwood scene in order to allow for more combat. \u000a\u000aAfter our craziest bloodbath yet, we have an overly long scene introducing another Jackson creation: Bard, the Barge-Sailer who apparently got mixed up with Bard, the Captain of the Guard. You see, the former makes a whole bunch of claims that are actually true about the latter. Why do we need to mess up the Lake-Town sequence? If you guessed "To set up another impossible bloodbath", give yourself a vacation to a combat zone. This round of combat is only after we leave four dwarfs behind because one of them got the Witch-King's knife disease that Frodo got in Fellowship but this time it came from an arrow fired by Bolg who has absolutely nothing better to do since Azog took all his screen time. Of course, Kili is saved by Tauriel, Captain of the Guard of the Woodland Realm who somehow has the same healing capability as Lord Elrond Half-Elven, wielder of one of the three Elven Rings of Power and a direct descendant of the Kings of the Noldor. It is rather fortunate Tauriel is there, because otherwise, Kili would have to wait for the next movie to have his deathbed dialogue, provided Jackson even sends Fili and Kili to Erebor where they're supposed to be. I'm all for the suspension of disbelief, but this doesn't even make sense in the fantasy universe.\u000a\u000aAnd don't forget the dragon. In Lake-Town, the viewer is reminded multiple times that Smaug can only be killed by a special ballista-bolt, strangely called an arrow, and only in one tiny spot on his stomach. In the mountain, Bilbo points it out again. But Peter Jackson apparently pays no heed to the script with his own name on it and gives the viewer a 30 minute "Let's Kill the Dragon Sequence". Take a guess who doesn't die in this sequence. If you said Smaug, the Fire- Breathing Dragon, you are more qualified to direct this movie than Peter Jackson. \u000a\u000aI loved the Rings film trilogy and, with the exception of Azog, the first Hobbit film. This film though, has almost no plot development, almost no consistency with the timeline given by Tolkien, almost no attention paid to its own script, and entirely too much combat. I remember Jackson being criticised for the warg battle in Towers but that did not require any plot change except for the location of the death of Hama (a very minor change) and the whole Aragorn-cliff- dream-thing which serves to heighten the tension before a battle that is done far better in the film. The warg battle helped to make a good fantasy film. This film seems like it is trying to see how many people can be killed before it gets an R rating from the MPAA. Deviations from the book are good if it enables better cinema but not when it allows for "Let's Kill Everything We See: The Movie".

VThis movie is so far from the story found in the book that Peter Jackson wouldn't have needed to get the rights from the Tolkien estate. I disagree with many of the naysayers who think this shouldn't have been turned into a three part series. There is plenty of story, action, and character development in the book to make three reasonable length films. The issue with how Jackson has handled this "adaptation" is that they have truncated most of the important elements to the original story simply so they could make up drawn out action scenes for the sake of action.\u000a\u000aThe film immediately came off the rails in what should have been the queer lodgings chapter. I was fully expecting another fun scene like An Unexpected Party; where Gandalf lures Beorn into letting a company of Dwarfs stay in his house. What we get is a rushed scene where the entire company barrels their way into his barn-ish house fleeing from Beorn and locking him out of his own house. Then without explanation Beorn is fine with all the dwarfs piled in his house just because he hates orcs more then he hates dwarfs. This was one of my favorite scenes in the book and I was really disappointed with how awful it was done.\u000a\u000aNext we get to the edge of Mirkwood where Gandalf seems to suddenly discover he needs to go to the south. In the book you get the impression that Gandalf with his great foresight planned to leave the party at the edge of the forest long before they got there. With Gandalf gone the rest of the company immediately become a bunch of morons who simply get lost in stupidity. The entirety of Mirkwood takes them less than 15min to traverse which really kills the feeling that it's a great and massive forest. There was no black river, not once did Bilbo say attercot to taunt the spiders while luring them away from the dwarfs. The Elves come in to save the day killing the spiders and then take the company of dwarfs to their prison cells. No twinkling lanterns, no fires in little glades that go poof when Bilbo or a dwarf tries to approach.\u000a\u000aThey are in and out of the Elvin prison in the blink of an eye with no sense of time that it took Bilbo to wander around learning his way around, scrounging for food and concocting his plan to escape. All of this was rushed through so we could have another action sequence of orcs chasing the party while elves chased them both but kinda helping the party of dwarfs. It makes no sense. Something that should have been done in a few cuts got extended to a 5min+ action sequence so they can show off their CGI.\u000a\u000aI could go on, but I'll skip ahead to the last part that never happens in the book. The last 15 minutes of the film is a drawn out action sequence of the Dwarfs and Bilbo battling Smaug inside the Lonely Mountain. In the book the Dwarfs never engage Smaug at all. The long straight secret tunnel leading to the hidden door is not long or straight at all in the film. To top it all off, the ending was cut as Smaug is flying away toward Lake Town. There is no battle, no burning of the city, no Smaug getting shot in the breast by Bard and thus falling into the lake causing it to billow up in a cloud of steam.\u000a\u000aIn summary this is not The Hobbit. It is some film that Peter Jackson made up as he went along with what (conservatively) is less than 40% parts of the books story. If you are a fan of Tolkien you will undoubtedly be let down by this excuse of a movie.\u000a\u000a-Patrick

VWe all remember how George Lucas created an amazing trilogy called "Star Wars," then went back later to do a prequel trilogy and tried to destroy the franchise by focusing on ridiculous visual effects and neglecting the story entirely; so too has Peter Jackson fallen.\u000a\u000aThe five points I have given are purely for the visual aspect of the movie. It is amazing. But we all expected that.\u000a\u000a0/5 for story. Tolkien wrote an amazing little (LITTLE) book called the Hobbit. Jackson could have fit the important and relevant parts of "An Unexpected Journey" into about an hour. It is the same here. There is a ridiculous amount of filler, needless side-plots, and a stupid (for lack of a better word) love triangle that makes a Ryan Reynolds romantic comedy seem deep. And I mean OK, I expect filler if you're going to turn a tiny book into three three hour movies, but at least keep what happens in the book if you're going to make stuff up. A few times scenes that were actually written by Tolkien feel rushed and cut short, while filler scenes seem to drag endlessly.\u000a\u000aSmaug had the potential to be great, and started out that way, but the gross on screen overuse of his character makes you think of a brainless rat running through a maze searching for cheese rather than the majestic dragon we all grew up reading about.\u000a\u000aI could keep on listing things I did not like (like bringing Legolas into the film to draw fans, and then overusing every cool thing he ever did in LOTR until you're sitting in your seat begging him to stop {ex, he surfs on EVERTYTHING}) but I am going to stop.\u000a\u000aGo see the movie on principle, but don't go looking for the nostalgia of LOTR like I did. Because even though it should be there, any chance these films had of greatness was lost in the desperate attempt to turn what should have been one great film into a three year money making machine.

VI watched this film for entertainment. I had no expectations. I don't mind if a director deviates from their source material, provided that the film works. However, I felt, as I watched, as if someone was patting my back, and picking my pockets.\u000a\u000aThere are some beautiful scenes: butterflies flying from the treetops of Mirkwood, Smaug gradually revealing himself, etc. Nevertheless, the visual virtuosity is wasted, because the scenes have no emotional impact. The characters are undeveloped, and barely interact with each other. There is no tension, no texture, no warmth. The story feels as fake as the over-the-top special effects.\u000a\u000aThe screenplay is insultingly bad by any standard. If you consider that it was adapted from the masterpiece of a world-class philologist, it's a crime against culture.\u000a\u000aIf I had to summarize the film, I would call it a juvenile, tasteless, video game-like action sequence. Take the barrel riders scene. A dwarf rolls along the shore in a barrel, knocking orcs off the screen, exactly like in the Donkey Kong Country games. Meanwhile, Legolas and Tauriel, in god mode, with unlimited arrows, and a perfect aim, are slaughtering hundreds of orcs. I felt my brain cells dying as I watched.\u000a\u000aIn conclusion, I left the theatre feeling violated. The film, to an even greater extent than its predecessor, embraces three things I despise about Hollywood: catering to the lowest common denominator, showcasing special effects at the expense of storytelling, and blatantly treating filmmaking as a business rather than as high art.

VI loved the LOTR movies despite the liberties Jackson took with the story (especially in The Two Towers) and I found the first Hobbit movie tolerable but this one stinks. Jackson seems to think that we like his story-making over Tolkien's. He has used his gratuitously added action scenes from those movies as the basis for almost the entirety of this 3+hour movie.\u000a\u000aThere is maybe 15 minutes of this movie that is from the book. The rest is stuff that Jackson wrote and never-ending CGI action shots that have such fast moving elements that you can barely tell what is going on and the characters perform feats that stretch belief so far that even the fantasy-world of Middle Earth cannot overcome. The character of Bilbo is diminished almost to a supporting one. The main characters of this movie are Tauriel and Legolas (the former made up by Jackson, the latter never appears in The Hobbit) and Bard. The character of Bard is totally changed from the noble protector of Lake-town to that of a ruffian on the margins of Lake-town society. The dwarfs were portrayed in the book as being a little cowardly, very greedy and bumbling. In the movie they are like a pack of Jackie Chan's with beards, even taunting the dragon to chase them through the halls of Erebor to try to catch him in a trap. From a cinematic critique Jackson continues his habit of massively exaggerating the scenery vertically so that as the party is making there way up the side of the Lonely Mountain it seems like they are climbing the Matterhorn.\u000a\u000aI could go on and on. Bottom line is this movie is lousy. I have watched each of the LOTR movies several times; I don't think I could sit through this movie for a second time.

VAdmittedly, I am biased from having read the wonderful book, but it looks like Peter Jackson has been writing his own story. He keeps making up pointless crap as an excuse to add more CGI and more fighting scenes. If you are looking for mindless fighting, zero dialogue, an overuse of CGI that would leave James Cameron shaking his head in disbelief, then sure, this movie is probably for you! However, if you are looking for the same emotion and magic that the book brings out in you, prepare to be disappointed, over and over again.\u000a\u000aBeorn is in the movie for about a minute and has the eloquence of a donkey with autism. Mirkwood before the elves appear is barely five minutes long. Which means the spiders disappear before they even got the chance to appear, and there is no Bombur falling in the water, and nothing to lure them off the path, they just get lost because they are extremely dumb dwarfs. Orcs are chasing them wherever they go, and the barrel- ride out of Mirkwood is a 20-minute long scene where nothing really happens, except a lot of orcs die, and Kili gets shot with a poisonous arrow(?). Then they bribe Bard into smuggling them past the guards into Lake-town. Apparently Bards ancestor shot off a piece of dragon scale under his left wing, so Bard already knows of the Dragon's weakness. No thrush has to tell him anything... All the dwarfs race into Smaug's lair and go on a rat-race in which Smaug is too brainless to actually kill anyone, and when he has an absolutely obvious shot at it, he suddenly has a change of heart and decides to let them live. Also, four of the dwarfs are still in Lake-town tending to the poisoned Kili and fighting orcs with the elves. Make sense? Not really, no. The book has been torched, and Peter Jackson has rewritten it the way it was (probably) intended; as a fighter-book with cool environments, cool people who say cool things, cool dwarven caves and cool statues. The things I have pointen out are only a few of the many changes and disappointments from the movie. Who needs a good story with all this CGI?\u000a\u000aThe acting is dreadful, the dialogue is dreadful, the CGI is dreadfully overused, the plot is dreadful (it's not the same as the book, believe me.) But the dragon was pretty cool. So therefore: 2/10.

VAbout three minutes in to The Hobbit: the Desolation of Smaug we find ourselves back in the company of our merry dwarfs, a wizard and a hobbit as they yet again find themselves fleeing from Azog the incompetent orc, who is attempting to kill them. The scene is fast, action packed and not particularly exciting. When the scene is finally at an end we are served with some forgettable dialog where the company discusses the danger they are in, accompanied by some dramatic background music. It's a sign of things to come. This is basically how you will spend the next 150 minutes or so: long, drawn out action scene, short futile discussion with dramatic background score, new drawn out action scene. Throughout the movie I found myself desperately searching for moments of silence. Scenes that would allow the audience a break from this video game like narrative, but it was almost never to be found. \u000a\u000aNow let me shoot in that I like to enjoy brainless action in movies and video games for that matter, but that doesn't mean that it's right for this movie. The Hobbit is an adventure film and should play out like fairy tale. But this fairy tale suffers from a lack of restraint. It has too much action, and amazingly, too much score. It has never been an annoyance in the past, but really, does every piece of dialog have to be accompanied by score? The source material for this film; the passages of the book which describe the long walk through Mirkwood forest, the escape from the elves and the arrival in Lake town are some of the funniest, most memorable and imaginative from the entire book. To my disappointment, all the charming little scenes where Bilbo runs around invisible with his ring to help the dwarfs out of new trouble, are cut short and hastily rushed through. You get the feeling that the director is short on time and has to get it over quickly, but to make room for what exactly? How on earth is it that a trilogy consisting of three 160 minute films, all based on a short book, doesn't have the time to fully delve in to the most memorable passages from said book? Especially when these passages would have given the film some much needed pacing and comical relief. The answer came towards the end. The reason for why the film needed to move quickly was to make room for new elaborate and drawn out action scenes - all of them completely unnecessary for the plot. Now, I am no Tolkien purist, and I don't mind a little creative freedom if it serves a purpose. In the Desolation of Smaug, the only purpose seems to have been to satisfy anxious producers that the film would have enough orc on dwarf/elf/human action, which they obviously see as the only factor that made the three first films a success. \u000a\u000aThere are no peaks and valleys. Only a succession of ever higher peaks. Every scene seems more action packed or dramatic than the next, with hardly any humor at all, leaving us completely numb to everything that happens. The criticism is one I could also direct at the first Hobbit movie, but it was nowhere near as unrestrained as this one. The Desolation of Smaug is more related to Peter Jackson's King Kong than the original trilogy, and one is left to wonder how the Fellowship of the Ring would have looked like, if it had been made with the same creative philosophy as the Desolation of Smaug. In all likelihood the most charming scenes would have been cut short to make room for an hour-long battle in Moria. Let us only hope that the next film manages to show some restraint in the build up the battle of the five armies. \u000a\u000aThe only redeeming qualities in this film are the set pieces, which have been wonderfully put together in the same manner of which we have come to expect from the previous films. The polish and color filters could have been toned down a bit, but visually the film is still a masterpiece.

VFirst, I want to say that I loved the LOTR trilogy. The spirit of the movie is close to the spirit of the books, even though the action scenes are more dominant in the films.\u000a\u000aThe Hobbit has a completely different spirit than the LOTR trilogy. Though I am adult, and the Hobbit is considered a children's book, I enjoy it a lot. I have read the book a couple of times and listen to it (as an audio book in Swedish, with a very talented reader) and it is just a wonderful journey.\u000a\u000aBoth the story-telling and the story itself has a great number of intricate and humorous moments. With Peter Jackson's talent of making the LOTR trilogy into the three movies I had great expectations of the Hobbit movie. Unfortunately, PJ has just made another LOTR-movie which has very little to do with the Hobbit.\u000a\u000aIn my point of view, the greatest moment of the book was when the dwarfs, Bilbo and Gandalf visited Beorn. For the movie, I just couldn't wait to see how PJ had tackled the big hassle Gandlaf had to introduce all the dwarfs to Beorn. In the book, he had to introduce them two by two, during a long period of time. Just to make Beorn comfortable with so many visitors. PJ left this wonderful scene and changed it to an action scene, where the company just sieged Beorns house and didn't let him in. That makes the film story to something completely different than the book.\u000a\u000aThen, I was curious whether the company would be served by animals, as they are in the book. That could have been a challenge, and PJ didn't take it, but placed a normal cow and goat in the kitchen and living room.\u000a\u000aIf you are around 13 years old, never read a book and obviously not the Hobbit, and love to play Grand Theft Auto - this might be a decent movie to watch. Otherwise: skip it.\u000a\u000aThe only positive thing with the PJ:s movie being so bad and so far from the book, is that there is room for a REAL The Hobbit movie in the future!

VIf you were thinking about seeing The Desolation of Smaug, do yourself a favor and stay home. It's close to 3 hours of your life you will never get back. The plot has almost nothing to do with the book. There are completely fabricated characters and there is NO character development. In fact, I had to go stand in the hall for a minute because my brother & I were laughing so hard about the fact that the third movie could be 3 hours of the cast members literally destroying copies of The Hobbit and it would probably be a better movie than this. The last 30 minutes are completely made up, insulting to Tolkein, and painful to watch. I would actually pay more than I paid to see the movie to get those 3 hours of my life back. I am at a loss for words at how Peter Jackson did so well with the Lord of The Rings movies and then seemingly had a seizure while holding a pen and decided to call it a script and go with it. I think they thought that bringing back Legolas would help the movie, but in fact they only detracted by going ahead & writing him as a bland character who is now, instead of being primarily an archer, a ninja swordsman of some sort. They also opt to attempt to squeeze in a love story instead of actual events that happened in the book, because dull romance sells. If you love the book as much as I do and have any sort of positive expectations for this film, you will be severely let down.

VWhile I enjoyed the first Hobbit film, it did feel like it left a bit to be desired. This was no surprise, as everything that I loved about the book was in the second half. I knew that I would be waiting for all the good stuff with the second and third films. And sure enough, the second film delivers where the first film didn't quite excite as much as I had wanted. While it isn't perfect and does unnecessarily deviate a bit, this is easily better than the first film, giving us a bigger, bolder adventure and a more interesting Bilbo Baggins this time around.\u000a\u000aBefore I get to the good stuff, let me get my complaints out of the way. My biggest complaint are the unnecessary plot threads. There seems to be a big need for this series of films to tie into LotR, and I really don't understand why. A great deal of time is taken in this film to introduce us to things we already know the outcome of. We're, at points, taken away from the dwarfs and Bilbo to follow Gandalf as he goes off on his own adventure to uncover the growing evil of Sauron and his armies. Like the first film, it's completely unnecessary, but unlike that film, it's jarring. We're ripped from a fantastic adventure to a story that we don't really need to know and has no real relation to the dwarfs and their adventure. In fact, any time we're taken out of the company of the dwarfs, it almost feels cheap. The almost romance between Evangeline Lily's elf and the dwarf Kili feels something of the same, the whole lot of these stories coming off as filler in an effort to make time for three movies instead of just two. It feels like a stretch and brings a screeching halt to the momentum of the main story.\u000a\u000aThat said, the rest of the film is an excellent and expertly crafted adaptation. There is a definite sense of character growth, especially from Bilbo, who seems to struggle with the power of the ring and it's greed. We already know where this goes, but it is none the less fascinating considering who he was when we first met him. The dwarfs seem to almost take a back seat here. They are less prominent, with the exception of Thorin and Balin, who take front and center. That isn't to say they aren't entertaining, as they usually are every time they are on screen. Thorin is the real standout though, as he goes through similar changes as Bilbo, which lends them an interesting comparison in their mutual struggles. The actors are all excellent once again in their respective roles, with Freeman once again being the standout. Evangeline Lily is also a pleasant surprise in an original role as an elf created for the film. She adds a much needed feminine touch to an otherwise predominantly male cast. She proves herself to be a fine silver screen presence and hopefully this will net her some further film roles.\u000a\u000aWhile the film does an excellent job of not simply being the middle film, something The Two Towers struggled with in the LotR trilogy, it is the action, set pieces, and effects which are the true stars. This may not be a LotR movie, but it's close. We almost immediately start out with a bang and it rarely lets up. Of course, much of what happens early on, as exciting as it may be, pales in comparison to it's explosive and lengthy climax. Smaug is quite possibly the best creation of any of the film, Hobbit or LotR. He is as awesome as you could have hoped for and Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role. While effects have been applied to his voice to give it more boom, he does a fantastic job as the sneering, wise, and boastful dragon. Watching and listening to him face off against Bilbo is a delightful treat, and that is before we get to any fire breathing and chasing. What follows is a lengthy conclusion to the film that will excite and delight all. I have no qualms in saying that Smaug makes the entire film worth the admission of price. But don't go in expecting a solid conclusion. This is, after all, the second of a trilogy, so you can surely expect the film to leave you salivating for the next one.\u000a\u000aWhile this new Hobbit film still doesn't reach LotR heights, it is superior to the previous film, especially when it comes to being an enjoyable adventure. It feels like it matters to the trilogy and delivers on being an epic. And I simply can't rave enough about Smaug. If you didn't enjoy the first film, you may find yourself feeling about the same here. But at least this one has a cool dragon.

VAfter seeing the first Hobbit film I must admit that I could have cared less about seeing the second and indeed it took me a minute to get back into it and I was grateful for the film giving me a "12 months earlier" scene to sum up what I am supposed to be following. It wasn't that the first film was bad (it is too expensive to be bad) but more than constant action and movement with no consequences or realism to engage me, really left me looking at a video game that I had no investment in (and I say this as a gamer). I didn't hope for much better when I went to see this sequel and, as Theo Robertson has said, perhaps this helped me enjoy the Desolation of Smaug more.\u000a\u000aThe plot has more to it than one encounter after another and connecting it to the later films was a good move that made me feel there was more content here – although I think that was artificial, I will not deny that it worked. The action sequences retain the same problems as the first film, which is that nobody ever feels like they are in real danger no matter how long the fall, how low the odds or what is happening. The good thing is that because the film isn't one escape sequence after another, I didn't feel this so often – although it is undeniably still a problem in these films. The characters were a little better than before although perhaps I was just more interested in them. Smaug in particular is a great creation – visually and stylishly; just like the first film where my favorite parts were the still and tense sequences with Gollum, so too here the high point of the whole film is where Smaug is toying with his potential victims and it is such a shame that this was not done longer.\u000a\u000aVisually the film remains a feast – although, befitting the time of year, it is a Christmas feast where everything is good but it is endless and eventually just feels indulgent and gluttonous. This remains the case because the film almost never feels like it was shot wholly on a location. I remember the LotR films impressing me with their natural beauty but here even a shot of people walking across a field seems to have been digitally enhanced and, as good as it looks, it does remove me from the film somewhat. Visual effects are impressive but it does really hurt to see Jackson leaning towards the George Lucas "if we can do it then we should do it" school of effects management. The cast do solid jobs – I liked Freeman and McKellan when they were allowed to be more than just special effects The dwarfs made more of an impression on me this time but the elves not so much – Bloom remains stiff while Lilly sports the only unconvincing effect in the film in the shape of her ears. Cumberbatch was strong as the voice of Smaug and I enjoyed Fry and McCoy in supporting roles (shame the latter missed out on more time due to his Doctor Who efforts during the 50th anniversary year!).\u000a\u000aThe Desolation of Smaug is a solid blockbuster; lots of action, a decent story and strong special effects – this is not the same as saying it is a great film though, but it does still entertain. The story remain distant due to the invincible characters and consequence free (but very seriously presented) action, which does prevent one being drawn into it. Of course I'll be there for the final film, but I really do hope than they focus on danger rather than spectacle and build the tension instead of just increasing the noise.

VThe second Hobbit film connects you better to the characters than the first in an entertaining ride with more danger, excitement, and humor. The action is well done, and the 3D adds to it, especially in the "whitewater rafting" scene. That part and the whole movie has good editing. In this one, two of the non-King dwarfs' presence is stronger (Balin and Kili). The she-elf warrior Tauriel and what comes with her works, adding some heart to the film. \u000a\u000aBesides Richard Armitage leading the way as the King under the Mountain with his great chemistry with fellow castmates, there are three actors who give specially noteworthy live-action performances. Lee Pace is one of the true highlights as Thranduil, who is an Elf King that deals with foreboding in a way that is different from Elrond. Ian McKellen's acting is comparable to him in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as he takes advantage of Gandalf getting his own storyline and heart-pounding action scene. Martin Freeman is good once again as the brave titular character, and actually slightly better. \u000a\u000aThe confrontation with Smaug is very enjoyable. It is a long movie, but the finale is the high point. Benedict Cumberbatch does an excellent job with the arrogant beast's voice, and the dragon looks really cool in 3D. I personally think that they ended it at the perfect place. When they divide a book up, it will inevitably result in a cliffhanger feeling. But, I am satisfied with how they handled it.

VA large proportion of the film is over-taken with elf-orc fight scenes: two elves that aren't even in the book manage to heroically slaughter hundreds of orcs in scenes that aren't in the book.\u000a\u000aThe ridiculous 'not in the book' love interest between the female not-in-book elf and dwarf culminates in her healing him from a wound that didn't happen in the book, which separates him from the others (again, not in book) using magical powers that it is really unlikely she would have even if she did exist as only a tiny number of elves have that power.\u000a\u000aThen at the end, in more 'not from the book' drama, it would seem that hiding behind a sliver of stone will shield people completely from nearby dragon-fire. DRAGON FIRE which apparently doesn't get you if you turn the corner or jump off the cliff in the nick of time.\u000a\u000aThis lies at the heart of what is wrong with this film, it is trying to turn the Hobbit into an action movie complete with totally unbelievable escapes from danger. This is (theoretically) based on a children's book, it should be more Narnia and less LOTR. Just because they are in the same world should not make this a prequel to LOTR.\u000a\u000aAlso, all of this inserted stuff really grates and is mostly boring as it has no substance. I don't believe films have to slavishly follow the book but any changes should be justified and these most definitely are not.\u000a\u000aFinally, the new bits are given precedence over the actual story and original content. How can they turn a single book into three films and yet cut-down or skip or rush through loads of really good bits from the book? How can they expand the fake characters at length and yet the real characters are barely used? Only a couple of the dwarfs are even distinguishable from each other.\u000a\u000aNo real attempt has been made to dramatise or flesh out the Hobbit book at all. This is a completely different film. And not even a good one.

VAfter a disappointing AUJ I really wanted to like this film. Unfortunately I've now lost complete faith in PJ's magic. \u000a\u000aThere are so many flaws in this film I don't even know where to start. From characters that are invincible (fighting barehanded giant spiders or Orcs !) which removes all tension from the film to utterly incomprehensible and unconvincing scenes (creation of giant dwarf gold statue in 5 minutes while a fire breathing dragon is on a rampage) this movie is just awful. Dialogues seem to be written by a 10 year old and the behavior of the protagonist contradicts what is expected from them (Why does the king of dwarfs threatens Bilbo despite their bond in AUJ? Why do the dwarfs leave one of theirs sleeping in the village? Why do the dwarfs leave so quickly the mountain once they realize that they can't find the keyhole?). The village scenes add no value to the story (fillers) and the love triangle is forced and unconvincing. \u000a\u000aWorst, Smaug which seemed to be an eloquent and highly intelligent character in the first five minutes of dialog with Bilbo is then transformed into a stupid creature who can't find slow-paced and pudgy dwarfs in his lair. What a waste of material - Smaug could have been one of the best villains coming out of Hollywood. Now it's just a dumb dragon which likes to talk like a posh Englishman. \u000a\u000aThe 3D doesn't add any value to the film (contrary to Gravity) and the CGI was poor (why make a horse in CGI?). LOTR was more convincing. In the end neither my wife or I cared for any of the characters (existing or new). This film was an insult to our intelligence. We deserved much better.\u000a\u000aI've put 2 stars. One for the first five minutes of dialog with Smaug (only real moment of the film with some tension) and one for the fine acting of Gandalf and Bilbo as usual.

VAfter watching the first Hobbit movie, I didn't want to think that Peter Jackson had jumped the shark, but he was certainly gunning the engine and racing towards that ramp next to the shark tank at full speed. With "Desolation of Smaug", he's over the tank and has crash landed hard on the other side.\u000a\u000aThe first movie took a lot of liberties with the original book and changed the tone entirely. The second one might as well not have claimed to be based on the book at all. It races through the few scenes that actually came from the book at breakneck pace just so it can get to the overlong scenes with characters who weren't in the book, or the scenes that beat the viewer over the head with the idea that this is a prequel to Lord of the rings, or the many, many, many ridiculous action scenes. For example, the chapter from the book that tells of the company's stay with Beorn comes and goes in what feels like about three minutes at the beginning of the movie, and bears (no pun intended) almost no resemblance to the book. Meanwhile, there's at least ten times that much footage of elves who weren't in the book beheading orcs and goblins throughout the film.\u000a\u000aAs many others have stated, I watched the Lord of the Rings movies many times in the theater and on DVD, but I have absolutely no urge to re-watch either of the first two Hobbit movies, and probably won't even bother seeing the third one.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I'd like to see films taken away from Jackson and given to a decent editor to see if he could make a two hour movie that's actually based on the original book.

VTolkien's works mean a great deal to me. I spent my childhood reading and rereading The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and whatever else I could get my hands on published posthumously. The Hobbit is a gentle story. Bilbo, with some help from Gandalf and the Dwarfs, is able to accomplish amazing things, despite his small size, because of his luck, wits, and strength of character. The other characteristic of the book is the vastness, diversity, and beauty of the world, filling one with curiosity for what is just around the corner, but also taking just enough time to linger a while in every place.\u000a\u000aThese Hobbit movies don't linger, characters and scenes are abridged in all the wrong places in order to make time for pervasive and repetitive chase scenes. Even where there isn't a chase scene, they are added. Jackson seems to have taken every scene in the book and asked the question "how can I make this into a battle/chase scene?" Bilbo's power and strengths, are greatly usurped in this film by the intervention of Legolas saving the day each time. Beorn is truncated. The magic and mystery of Mirkwood is particularly lacking. The gentle escape from the elves in the barrels is turned into a farce obviously designed to tie in with a future theme park ride.\u000a\u000aDon't see the films nor allow children to see them before reading the books. You should exercise your brains and imagination, creating the images yourself, rather than letting someone else imagine for you, causing you to be stuck with the images from these mediocre films.\u000a\u000aJackson seems to know nothing of the poetry of the book, of mythological archetypes, language and history, nor the unique, gentle fantastic quality of Tolkien's work. Its very sad.

VEven though I formally thought "An Unexpected Journey" was a bit chipped off by quality from the original "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, due to its certain lack of seriousness the former Jackson Middle-Earth films had, I wasn't really disappointed by it. It was a different, more softer storyline, and under it had to have a different directorial approach. Going to see the second one, I had my worries if it's going to be on a dose less of action and excitement and more centered on the characters, which I always kind of felt myself, was a mistake for a purely adventure film, a road that many movies have taken on in sequels. Fortunately, it was nothing of a sort. "Desolation" gives a stronger adventure and enjoyment than the original Hobbit movie. Faster pace, beautiful sets, lovely score, costumes and most impressive CGI than ever before, with the comeback of one of the most beloved character of the original series, Legolas, will surely win over the audiences both fans of Tolkien's book and not, over the globe again this Christmas season. If anything, I'll definitely go catch it again. Thumbs up!

VThis movie is unwatchable. Peter Jackson takes so many liberties with the characters and plot that you would never have known this was based on the Hobbit. I would expect a film like this to come from George lucas. the action sequences were too many, and too unrealistic (if you loved the obnoxious scene in LOTR when legolas single handedly brings down an entire massive elephant you will crap yourself when you see him standing on the heads of two dwarfs in separate barrels in a raging river, firing an endless number of arrows into the heads of orcs and the barrels don't separate. \u000a\u000ayou will not recognize the characters you loved from the book. you will leave the movie wondering if any directors have any interest in making movies that have any sense of meaning or wonder, rather than making masterbatory action films with no meaning or actual feeling.

VI went into the cinema with high expectations. I loved the first Hobbit film as I thought it was a superb film which kept true to the book and the slight deviations which did occur were harmless. However, when this film finished I was shocked and outraged. This film was absolutely nothing like the book. I am a big Tolkien fan and a know-it-all when it comes to middle-earth and its history so after seeing this film desecrating the story it completely infuriated me. I just don't know what was going through his head when he decided to leave four of the dwarfs behind, and what on earth was the whole sequence of the barrels about and Kili getting shot. This film had absolutely 0% accuracy to the book. Did he have a knock on the head or something? Why did it? The Hobbit is one of the most beloved children's books of all times and Jackson goes a completely changes it. The CGI for Smaug was impressive but he just wasn't portrayed as cunning, devious and intelligent as in the book. Legolas again was portrayed as a super-elf defying the laws of physics. But the thing I don't understand the most is how they got some of the fundamental ideas wrong. They portray Tauriel, with her healing powers, as a high-elf. like she is one of the Noldor. Which is complete nonsense. \u000a\u000aThey portray Thranduil as a potentially corruptible elf king as he is interested with gold.\u000a\u000aAlso the nonsense and made up material for how Gandalf goes into Dol Guldur by himself is just absurd, didn't they bother reading the appendix and silmarillion.\u000a\u000aSomething else I don't understand is why for the named villain they didn't use Bolg instead of Azog. Azog was killed before the hobbit took place by Dain Ironfoot and Bolg (Azog's son) was still alive, why did they resurrect Azog?\u000a\u000aI don't think I will buy the film on DVD and I definitely won't go and see the last one. Undoubtedly, he will change the battle of five armies and probably have Bilbo kill Smaug. \u000a\u000aOverall I think this film was a complete failure and actually nothing like the book. It was one of the most disappointing films I have seen. It was more disappointing than the inaccuracy of the LOTR trilogy. Jackson is a dreadful director and how he came to direct such fantastic books is beyond me.

VThis movie really blew it for me. Here is why, in increasing order of distastefulness.\u000a\u000a1. Not taking the time to properly tell the many little stories in the book. This is too bad, because they were good stories. Beorn, Mirkwood, Elf fires, Bilbo and the spiders, Bilbo and the dragon, etc. are all abbreviated or simply left out.\u000a\u000a2. Developing sub plots which were only alluded to in the book. These added depth to the world around the story, but fully played out they are irrelevant and obsessed with the LOTR plot. Radagast, the Necromancer, etc. are distractions, and doubly so with their relentless focus on premonition of events from the next 3 books. This also assumes that the director has more interesting stories to tell than the author did. He does not.\u000a\u000a3. Adding characters and plots that were never in the book. The Pale Orc, Legolas, Tauriel, dwarf/elf romance, etc. These force the plot to change, distract from the story, and are weak compared to the original. Again the director demonstrates that the author was a better storyteller than he is. Plus, this allows for cringe-worthy scenes such as the one where the hottie-kungfu-elf-she-warrior saved her love interest dwarf from a morgul arrowhead with magic spells and herbs just in time to kill a bunch of orcs who ninja-style invaded lake town. \u000a\u000a4. Doing another Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom style roller coaster ride. This was cute in the 80s, but is simply insulting at this point in time, and particularly in this story. Does one of the great stories of the 20th century really need a roller coaster ride to make it interesting? The moment I saw the dwarfs sliding down to waiting coal cars, I realized that I'd had enough. This was where I walked out shaking my head.\u000a\u000aI'm sad about this movie because I loves these stories, and I doubt they'll ever be told in film again. This was almost as bad as the John Carter movie!

VI grew up reading and rereading and loving the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. I enjoyed Jackson's Trilogy but I think the Hobbit has suffered greatly in the translation from book to screen.\u000a\u000aThe Desolation of Smaug is almost unrecognizable as part of the Hobbit - the love story between the dwarf and the wood elf, the bizarre rewriting of the escape from the wood elf stronghold, the battle between the handful of dwarfs and Smaug in the mountain in which the dwarfs nearly get the better of Smaug (!!!) are just some of the egregious examples of poetic license taken by Jackson.\u000a\u000aTo add insult to injury it is only part II of III. You've got to be kidding!!! The Hobbit is all of about 300 pages versus nearly 1500 pages for the Trilogy. This is simply gross money-mongering at the expense of the audiences. Sorry, I love Tolkien's The Hobbit just not The Hobbit Movie. Old JRR must be rolling over in his grave.

VIt can't be much fun being an Orc, can it? Not only is your acne so bad you're unlikely to get a girlfriend, but you spend your whole life trying to kill hobbits and dwarfs who are, for all intents and purposes, immortal. Maybe it's only bad ugly Orcs that do the chasing. Maybe there some more appealing Orcs running an organic farm in Orcshire.\u000a\u000aEven when they manage to give one of the dwarfs a nick on the leg which, of course, with Orc poison means certain death, he only needs a bit of rub with the special green stuff and he's right as reign. What happened to certain death? Being a dwarf is only marginally better. None of them are allowed a discernible character, and, apart from the clashing accents, they're entirely interchangeable. It might have been better to call them something like Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy and Sneezy. That would at least have given them some sort of character and a potential character arc. Sneezy might benefit, for example, from a lesser known property of the Arkenstone, which is clearing up sinus problems.\u000a\u000aApart for the main dwarf (who wants to get the Arkenston, but will its power turn him evil? - anybody care?) and the good looking normal-size dwarf, who gets the fatal cut on his knee, but survives in order to get off with the only woman in the whole of Middle-Earth - doesn't this lack of women suggest a bit of population renewal issue here. How is Peter Jackson going to be able to produce his next trilogy when everyone's died of old age? I'm not sure the whole small-size thing ever worked in any of the Hobbit films. There was some stuff between Gandalf and Frodo at the beginning that almost did it, but after that the dwarfs never seemed very small, and nor did the hobbits. And of course the Hobbit hairy feet thing never convinced – they just look like a pair of unconvincing hairy slippers from the Pound Shop.\u000a\u000aWizards would seem to have the most going for them. They are old and they are wise – apart from the bad ones of course who are old, wise and nasty. Wizards present a slightly harder issue plot wise, because, put them into any seemingly impossible situation, for example, I don't know, hanging off a tower in an iron cage, and all they have to do is go, 'Piff Paff' and they're away. You can't even kill them. Gandalf gets killed by the Balrog in LOTR1, and, Piff Paff, he's back as Gandalf the White in LOTR 2. If he gets killed again he's still got green, red, and blue to go. No wonder Orcs are so bad-tempered – it's like England playing Australia.\u000a\u000aSmaug the Dragon does look pretty impressive at the cost of a few million dollars although Ray Harryhausen did better with twenty quid and some plasticine and wire. Still, at least the dragon looks good. Trouble is, he never stops droning on and, even though can blast fire out of his nostrils with the power of six flame throwers, he's a totally useless shot and nobody gets so much as a flaming bum.\u000a\u000aAnd I have to say the dwarfs idea of killing the dragon is a bit convoluted considering they're making it up as they go along. The plan is, to get the dragon to fire up to the old furnace by standing in front of him, so when he totally misses them AGAIN he accidentally starts the fire burning. Then they have to channel the molten gold into a mold of a big warrior and then they're going to melt him down again, and cover the dragon with the molten gold. 'Couldn't we just stab him?' No you can't, 'cause we've need at least another fifteen minutes of the dragon totally missing everyone.\u000a\u000aAnd even after all that he doesn't die, just flaps his wings a couple of times and off he goes – he's worse than Gandalf. It's almost as if Peter Jackson said, 'Oh no, we've killed the dragon and we've got another three hour film to make before next Christmas.\u000a\u000a'But we've just buried him in molten gold.' 'Never mind that, I need him back. Oh I know, maybe he can just jump out of the molten gold and shake it all off like water off a wet dog' 'Yeah, that'll do it.' \u000a\u000aAnd there's an awful lot of stuff that seems just tacked on to fill time: For example there's the boatman bloke, who Steven Fry doesn't like and neither does his a cockney assistant. Lake Town is full of extras going, 'I really hope his kills the dragon don't you.' 'Gosh yes. Hurray for the Dwarfs!! 'Shall we do a little dance. People might do that if they were sending dwarfs off to fight dragons off, mightn't they?' \u000a\u000aNot wishing to put you off next year's The Hobbit: Three More Hours of Rushing About Pointlessly but, on top of the town hall at Lake Town, there's a giant catapult thing and the Boatman has a special arrow: The-Only-Thing-That-Can-Kill-Dragons-Special-Arrow. I wonder what on Middle-Earth is going to happen in Episode Three? But before that, we've got the four and half out extended edition of The Hobbit: The Despair Of Smaug At Ever Hitting Anyone on Blue Ray to look forward to. In this version, the dwarfs do some more running, and the Orcs do some more chasing, and Smaug does some more missing, and when the dwarfs come back in the boat, there's a real tiger on board, and maybe they can go to this island when there's a huge monkey or where meddling scientists have created real dinosaurs… I tell ya. I can hardly wait

VThis movie MIGHT make a decent typical action CGI cartoon-like modern flick (by today's low standards), but it was supposed to be so much more. I think I might have somewhat liked- or at least tolerated- it if it was a story cooked up by Peter Jackson without claiming to be based on the great historical tale of Tolkien's "The Hobbit". But, it claims to be "The Hobbit", and not "Peter Jackson's Wacky Tales from Middle Earth" so I looked at it against the true Tolkien story. From that viewpoint, this movies fails so bad that it is hard to write a review at all. And it failed even worse than "The Hobbit Part 1". \u000a\u000aWhere to begin?.. The Dwarf Kili who looks more human than the human characters in this film (you would think with PJ's love of special effects, they would not have overlooked this). He doesn't fit and what is worse, they have him playing puppy-love games with a female elf who is not even supposed to be in the movie. This female elf has a very large and completely fabricated role. It's like PJ plucked the idea from the "Twilight" films where the girl is torn between the werewolf and vampire boyfriends- only this elf is torn between the human looking dwarf and Legolas. Oh, and Legolas wasn't in the real story either. His role here would have been OK if kept minor, but an entire contrived subplot that gives him an action hero role is unnaturally injected into the story in order to give Orlando Bloom way too much screen time. I write this having actually liked his part in Lord of The Rings. Radagast is almost as bad as he was in Hobbit 1 and Gandalf is worse. A MAJOR snafu on PJ's part is that the one plot point that carries through all the real stories is the journal Bilbo started keeping at the start of Mirkwood that eventually becomes Bilbo's & later Frodo's life work is totally left out (and this plot point is prominent in PJ's LOTR films and the book is handed down to Samwise). I could go on, but anyone who knows Tolkien gets the idea. I loved the PJ's LOTR movies, but I hate what PJ & crew have done with "The Hobbit" >:(\u000a\u000aOne more point: PJ claimed that he used material from the LOTR appendix to get the filler to make 3 Hobbit movies, but that's not what he put in the Hobbit movies. The filler is made up from the mind of PJ & crew, not taken from the LOTR appendix. PJ must think he is better write than Tolkien. He is NOT.\u000a\u000aEdit: Peter Jackson ruined the Lord of the Rings with this movie, how? The whole of the beginning of Fellowship was Gandalf unraveling the mystery of Sauron and the Ring, but now Jackson wants to spoon-feed every connection to the audience, so shows Sauron to Gandalf in Dol Goldur, thereby making the whole opening in Fellowship mute. The more I think about the Hobbit 1 & 2, they worse they are to me. If I had the stomach to watch them again, I am sure there would probably be dozens, if not hundreds, of more errors in these hashed plots.

VFor those of you who have never read the Hobbit (first off, shame on you) then you can disregard this review. You, like my husband, will probably enjoy this movie very much with the only complaint that it might be slow. \u000a\u000aHowever, for those of you who love the book as much as I do (it is probably one of my favorite books) you will be horrified as you watch this terrible film. The only good part about his movie is the beautiful rendition of Smaug and his interactions with Bilbo. Those are probably the most accurate parts portrayed in the movie from the book even though they are not exact. \u000a\u000aMajor things that went wrong in this movie: -The overall feel of the book that was slightly present in the first film is gone. They tried to make it to much like the Lord of the Rings saga. The Hobbit is a different type of book and has a completely different feel that made the movie just feel not right. -I just cannot get over the creepy dwarf and elf love triangle that was set up between Legolas, Tauriel, and Kili. First off, a relationship between a dwarf and an elf would be completely unheard off and very unlike dwarven and elven characteristics. It goes very against the characteristics of their "races" and made me almost want to just stop watching. Does every movie need a love story these days to be interesting? -There are parts of the book that are blatantly changed for no apparent reason. Some changes that were made were understandable to condense the book into three movies. However, some of the changes made the movie longer, boring, and were just plain idiotic (here come the spoilers, you were warned!). For example, at the end of the movie the dwarfs lead Smaug around in a game of cat and mouse that takes up a good deal of time. This never occurred in the book and it was a waste of time. Another example would be much of the "adventures" the dwarfs and Bilbo had in Lake Town. Literally none of the boring material was in the book and it didn't lend anything to the story especially when a handful of the dwarfs were left in Lake Town because of Kili being hurt (again, never happened in the book and aided nothing to the story line). I could list dozens of examples of ways in which the movie strayed from the book. -One thing that was disappointing was how Beorn was played. He almost had an idiotic giant feel to his character which is not at all how he was portrayed in the book. At least his ponies made an appearance in the movies. -The extra material not included in the Hobbit with Gandalf's travels to seek out the Necromancer was a little slow and, at the end, very corny. Trust me, you won't be able to miss that they are trying to make sure you can see the connection between the Necromancer and Sauron. It was a little much. -I was looking forward to the song that Bilbo sang to taunt the Spiders in the forest. When it wasn't in the movie I was very disappointed. It was a part in the book that aided to Bilbo's character and it was left out. I could go on forever about how terrible this movie was but I think I will end it there. Overall, go and see it just to say you have. However, it is definitely not a movie worth seeing more than once and I am not very excited to see the final film.

VTo start with, I think "Plan 9 from Outer Space" is a highly underrated movie. But watching this movie I really couldn't help thinking of watching the worst movie of all time.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, the direction. Peter Jackson's cheap and uninspired made-for-TV style hasn't improved at all since the first part of LOTR. Nor has his poor script writing. Time and time again the actors have to dramatically mumble silly one-liners like "The war is coming!" and stare into the camera as if they were in pain. They probably were, since all the actors generally seemed to be decent. The script also is just a loosely connected series of fights and battles time and time again containing pseudo-dramatic situations of the kind "all is lost", but since it's all so overdone, you know it will be all right and of course the story has to go on, too.\u000a\u000aParticularly the queeny elves with their perfect hairstyles annoyed me, their king is more of a queen, anyway. At least that leader of the dwarfes, the guy with the black long hair and the beard, was super hot.\u000a\u000aIt all ended with lenghty conversations with a dragon high on coke, I hoped he would kill them all, especially since the Hobbit looks like a German trash comedian (Bully Herbig) whom I detest. The dragon flew away in the end, my buddy, who knows the book, said this actually more or less is the end of the book, the next part probably will be filled with more battles and with more silly dialogue.\u000a\u000aIt's actually very sad that a great work of literature is reduced to such silly and trashy film making and script writing. If they had just made a fantasy movie based on their own script where you know it will be a superficial action fantasy movie with perfect hairstyles flowing around that would have all been well and good. But now Mr. Tolkien will have a very uneasy rest, shame on Peter Jackson! Ed Wood would have done a better job with all the money Peter Jackson had available!

VPeter Jackson's 3-episode interpretation of The Hobbit is turning into a sticky, gooey mess. What a horrid series of films.\u000a\u000aThis isn't about book purism or Tolkien loyalty or any of that. I understand the difference between writing and filmmaking, and why one can never translate directly into the other (especially when the latter occurs 75 years after the former). My contempt for the Desolation of Smaug concerns filmmaking itself: storytelling, dramatic tension, character development. Even the framing, action and stuntwork do not work in this film.\u000a\u000aThe root of the problem is PJ does not have an internal filter. He dreams up ideas of increasing ridiculousness, and throws them on the screen whether the story benefits or not. He dreams up wonderful elvish combat maneuvers: they're in the film. He dreams up various orc prosthetics: they're in the film. He dreams up goofy, hammy character appearances: they're in the film. He dreams up immense set pieces and constructs unbelievable battles in the midst: they're in the film. But you can't do filmmaking that way! Good films, even good action films, need to be built on a solid core of character and story. \u000a\u000aIn fairness, the Hobbit itself is not particularly meaty in those areas: it's a bit goofy, a bit sparse. It was a children's book, after all. But that's what a good screenplay needs to reinforce in such cases. It's what PJ and his writing team did in LOTR! They beefed up the story and added emotional context to the characters to make the audience care about what was happening. When Frodo was confronted by the Witchking in the Two Towers, you were afraid for the guy because the film, up to that point, made you care! \u000a\u000aIn the Hobbit, however, they are not shoring up the character and story in this three-layer cake at all. Instead, they are slathering on such a heavy coating of empty frosting in the form of goofy action sequences, sticking on gumdrops of forced slapstick comedy, and pouring on a thin crust of chocolate sprinkles in the form of CGI (much of which is poorly done and pulls you out of the film). In the end, you have a cake that's inedible because of all the sugary crud slathered on top. All this "stuff" totally overwhelms the cake in the center, completely obscuring the overall storyline, and smothering the characters of Gandalf, Bilbo, Thorin, and the rest of the poor dwarfs (who mumble along in complete obscurity for the duration of the film). Even Smaug gets short-shrift (he is a marvel of visual magnificence, but is also reduced to a slapstick fool before too long).\u000a\u000aWhat PJ does not have is a filter. You can tell he's gained so much power as a filmmaker that no one is challenging his decisions. He gets away with everything no matter how ridiculous, no matter how distracting, no matter how smothering. He has no sanity check, no capacity to self-edit. And the film suffers for it: it's so overdone in action and set pieces, you become bored with it. I was praying for the movie to be over by the end.\u000a\u000aWhen you engage in any creative endeavor, it's important you get all your ideas on the table, no matter how outlandish. But then you ALSO need to learn how to edit, how to scrape away everything that is not helping you tell your story or portray the vision. It can be a hard thing, giving up that great idea, but if it helps you reach your goal, you drop it by the wayside, and focus on what's important.\u000a\u000aPJ did not do that, and as a result, we have a sticky, gooey, sickly-sweet mess of a cake that will surely give us all diabetes.

VIn the words of J.R. Tolkien - "Things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway"(The Hobbit, Chapter 3, paragraph 26).\u000a\u000a"The Desolation of Smaug" is sure to satisfy those who thought the first installment dragged its feet. From the first frame to the last, the movie is a thrilling achievement of Peter's. The action is none like we've seen in any middle-earth installment. The visual effects are much improved, the pace is seamless, and the danger is ever more present. Yet through it all, Bilbo and the company's journey to reclaim the Lonely Mountain is not forgotten as the driving force of this tale.

VAs a huge fan of the original trilogy, who not only watched it in the theatres but purchasd every iteration of release, I'm shocked at this movie. I've watched the original 3 movies dozens of times, never feeling bored or lost in the storyline. They all had flow and connectedness through all the subplots and character development. This movie was all over the map with erratic editing and the feel of a made for TV soap opera. There are only so many times we need to see Legolas surfing on something while shooting arrows with an endless quiver at his side. Personally it would have done homage to the original 3 to maintain their cinematic construct and elements instead of jumping on the 3D high CGI bandwagon and losing the audience and storyline along the way. I wanted to leave 20min in but kept giving it the benefit of the doubt much to my segrin. Other members of the audience did leave. Highly doubt I will buy it on Blu-Ray either.

VThis is my first film review, and I am writing it down mainly because I need a way to get a load of hateful feelings off my chest... \u000a\u000aFirstly, I apologize for the harsh review title, for insulting is an easy way to criticize, but it is quite an accurate way of summarizing this review and a manner of expressing my feelings. Secondly, this is a long review but I hope you take some time reading it, especially if you have the same sensation as the title expresses. Thirdly, I am glad to see that a lot of people share similar impressions from a film that by far does not deserve three Oscar nominations and an 8.1 rating, even though lately these are seldom to be considered valuable. Finally, I will approach this film basically on its cinematographic aspects and less on its content or on its relevance with Tolkien's work, for the disrespect to film as an art form is in my opinion even greater than the disrespect to the book – which is clearly out of proportion. However, maybe the greatest scandal of them all is the one Jackson does to himself.\u000a\u000aTHE THREE PARTS\u000a\u000aConcerning this decision, diversified discussions exist. Many find it a dull idea because the book's content does not permit such a film length. Personally, I think it is an interesting idea to involve other elements from Tolkien's creation of Middle-Earth (Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, Children of Hurin), but Jackson totally ruins its potential. Instead of what he claims to do, he mostly fills it with ridiculously long and comic action scenes, an invented character – which happens to be really hot – and a cheesy, irrelevant love story. \u000a\u000aThese Hollywood clichés are the perfect recipe for capitalism, the compromise between art and business, even the complete neglect of art. What I find even more frustrating is how he then manages to make a 161 min. film with an overdose of fast moving cameras and less than one second during shots. Moreover, I am still unable to distinguish the dwarfs from one another and most of them barely even have lines. It also feels like Bilbo is disappearing behind Legolas and Tauriel. There are nearly no emotional connections being developed between the audience and the characters, compared to the LOTR trilogy, where strong bonds of empathy are constructed. \u000a\u000aTHE SOUNDTRACK\u000a\u000aIn An Unexpected Journey, the music is tolerable, although it certainly does not attain the magic of the LOTR soundtrack. However, here it seems as if Howard Shore ran out of inspiration, or does not find a way to bring the music to the front instead of letting it murmur in the background. And for Christ's sake, why in the world would you choose a sissy voice as Ed Sheeran's for your end credits, after a cliffhanger with a mighty dragon? Simply to expand the target public to teen girls and gain more profit.\u000a\u000aTHE ACTING\u000a\u000aActually, I cannot remember any of the actors acting well, except maybe for Martin Freeman. For almost all of the other characters, a general failure is the unbelievable overacting, which is sometimes almost worth crying for. OK, the acting in the LOTR is also very theatrical, but it perfectly fits in the Middle-Earth atmosphere and it is always convincing and emotionally provoking. However, in this film, almost every line is exaggerated and edited in a way the deep male voices sound 'really cool' (think of Beorn and Thorin). I am even disappointed in Ian McKellen, who throws some extremely overacted lines as well. \u000a\u000aA brief attention goes to the two love scenes between Tauriel and Kili. It reminds me of Jackson's The Lovely Bones, which is maybe the worst film I have ever seen. I thought he would not dare making such a mistake again. I was wrong. I could not believe my ears when Tauriel started saying meaningless, cheesy rubbish about the universe and it continued for at least five minutes. However, that was not enough… The scene where she is healing Kili's leg and an aura of white light appears was just making me sick. On the other hand, Benedict Cumberbatch's voice for Smaug is very convincing. \u000a\u000aTHE ACTION AND CGI\u000a\u000aA simple thing I don't understand about modern CGI is that it is meant to make look things very realistic, but it often results in the contrary. There is a huge difference with the LOTR, especially with the Orcs and Wargs. I also have the feeling Jackson rarely went looking for a good setting and he just added everything with CGI. There is no more time for admiration of the magnificent landscapes from the LOTR and even from An Unexpected Journey. The only CGI that blew my mind was Smaug's appearance. \u000a\u000aAnother important thing is the action, in which Jackson completely loses himself making the impossible combat experience, which ends up in a very computer game-like sensation. He forgets Middle-Earth is an imaginary world, but with realistic physics. The river scene, Legolas' and Tauriel's scenes, it is not even worth discussing…\u000a\u000aI could go on for hours, but sadly there is a 1000 word limit. I hope you now agree with the choice my review title, because Peter Jackson is a perfect example of one who is consumed by capitalism – what I consider to be a severe illness – and therefore does not take time to think of a worthy completion of his previous artwork. I find it really hard to imagine him watching his premiere, and thinking he has made a brilliant piece of work.\u000a\u000aThe Lord of the Rings really made my teenager years and I was really grateful Jackson existed, but now he just ruined every single bit of respect I had for him…

VI am a big fan of LOTR and whilst I thought AUJ was poor, I was willing to let that one go as a blip. With that in mind I had high hopes for TDOS which appeared from the trailer to be darker and grittier that the first instalment.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, what was presented was an absolute shambles. The plot is truly terrible and a mere shadow of the original book; the HFR 3D serves to visualise most of the film as a cheap, made-for-TV soap opera; there is virtually no character development and the CGI fight scenes are so bad it's just laughable.\u000a\u000aIn AUJ I found HFR 3D passable. It didn't distract me too much and maybe even enhanced parts of the film. However, in this instalment it was awful. The very first scene is almost unwatchable it's so bad and this is a theme that continues throughout most of the film. The character closeups are like watching a badly made TV show with all the limitations of costume and make-up clearly visible and the large-scale CGI scenes are like watching a computer game intro sequence. It just does not work.\u000a\u000aThe plot is only loosely based on the book. The great character of Beorn is just glossed over and the gorgeous Murk Wood is presented as a mere triviality. I was looking forward to a sinister spider scene but all that we got was some Disney-style nonsense that was not in the least bit scary.\u000a\u000aThe entire thing is conducted as if a child has written it... "...and then the dwarfs go into beorn's house and then beorn tries to kill them and then he's not bothered and then he hates them and then he doesn't and then we're bored of beorn and then they go to murk wood and then gandalf goes to find the necromancer and we don't really know what that is or why but just cos and then there are spiders and then the dwarfs are stuck in the webs and then they're not stuck anymore and then they box the spiders and win and then some really really good looking elves come along and one of them is legolas and he's not really a wood elf but we'll just pretend he is cos he's really really good looking and the other elf girl who's really really good looking gets the hots for one of the dwarfs erm yeah erm hmm and that probably seems a bit weird so then the dwarf tells her a story about the moon and then and then..."\u000a\u000aAnd now for the the fight scenes. Oh my god. Please just stop it. Please. If I see Legolas surfing around like some deranged beach bum with a bow and arrow one more time I think I'll throw up in the theatre. "Pathetic" doesn't even begin to describe the nonsense that is on display here.\u000a\u000aAnd why, when PJ or GDT or whoever started saying "... and then the dwarfs bait Smaug into lighting the furnaces and then hundreds of tons of solid gold melts in a few seconds and then the gold is made into a giant gold dwarf and then the giant gold dwarf splurges all over Smaug and then that's pointless anyway cos Smaug just shakes it off and then Smaug doesn't want to kill the dwarfs anymore just cos and then Smaug just flies off instead..." did someone not just stand up and slap whoever it was very hard in the face and say: "No. In then name of Gondor, I will not let you defile the work of the great Tolkien such"?

VBilbo Baggins and assorted dwarfs continue their journey to Erebor, overcoming various obstacles on the way (including hostile elves) before Bilbo has to try to fulfil his engagement as burglar under the fiery snout of antisocial dragon Smaug.\u000a\u000aThe second Lord Of The Rings movie suffered from Middle Film Syndrome: Hobbit 2, despite occupying the same position in a trilogy, does not suffer to the same extent, and perhaps this is because it is exciting all the way through, yet follows on from a film which was pretty slow throughout its first half.\u000a\u000aIt also contains large chunks which do not come from the novel - I'm pretty sure Legolas wasn't in the book. He is great fun here, as a much angrier soldier in the Elf Army. And new creation Tauriel is hugely enjoyable, resembling nothing so much as Uma Thurman's character from Kill Bill, albeit attractively played with the hint of a smile by Evangeline Lilly.\u000a\u000aApart from being a more engaging movie than part 1, pretty much everything I thought about that movie still holds. I still have reservations about the dwarfs - their faces and hair feel obviously prosthetic and wigged, and it's still pretty difficult to tell them apart from each other except for the old one, the one wounded by the orc arrow, Thorin, and James Nesbitt's Irish one. I still have reservations about CGI orc faces - the prosthetic orc faces work noticeably better. I still have reservations about some of the action sequences, where more is not necessarily better (one sequence, in particular had the audience laughing because of the extent to which the Elvish derring-do was over-derring-done). And there are times when Bilbo looks cut out and pasted into a scene. And, once again, the 3D is indifferent.\u000a\u000aOtherwise, this was great fun. Loads of action, some nice character work, an excellent and nasty spider fight, a well-voiced and visually realised Smaug, and not the slightest yen to look at my watch.\u000a\u000aAnd a cliff-hanger. You swine, Jackson.

VJust saw "The Hobbit 2: We Already Ran Out of Material." It's a bloated, poorly-paced mess of a film with dramatic lack of loyalty to its source that doesn't know what it's trying to do. Is it a comedy? An action film? A fantasy adventure? No, it fails at all three.\u000a\u000aI can accept that sometimes a movie adaptation of a book is different from its original source. That's just how adaptations work, and if Hobbit 2 were a good film on its own, I could forgive a lot of the seemingly-arbitrary changes. But it isn't. It's filled with inconsistencies, with stupid action scenes that don't make any sense (fire will still burn you even if you're six inches away from it, guys), with humor clumsily dropped in. \u000a\u000aI loved Lord of the Rings. I found the first Hobbit movie acceptable. But this mess of a film shows a complete lack of regard not only for the book it's supposedly based on, but also for film-goers who just want a good movie. It's silly, it's badly written, and it's bloated to the point that I was praying for it to end about an hour and a half in.\u000a\u000aLet's face facts: The Hobbit doesn't have enough material for three movies. The reason we're getting three is that the parent corporation shelled out big bucks for the sequels, so they had to find lots of needless material to shoehorn in. Friends don't let friends attend midnight showings of this terrible movie.

VAfter reading a lot of critic reviews over the past week I was really hopeful that this movie would be better then the first Hobbit film, which essentially was LOTR 1 with different (useless) characters. They said the action was going to be a lot better?? WRONGGGGG!!!! More garbage that Peter Jackson threw together and added CGI to. I could honestly care less about any of the characters in this movie, which is something I felt the opposite about in the LOTR trilogy, which I loved!! I actually sat there in the theater hoping some of those stupid dwarfs would just die. None of them are meaningful and honestly who wants to see a cast of all dwarfs in an action movie? They are short, fat and ugly and none of them are as good as Gimmili was in the first trilogy. Then they finally get to Smaug, this bad ass Dragon who should be able to kill them all in about 2 seconds, but instead create a 30 minute chase scene where somehow all them survive!! Are you kidding me, pointless! THen there's the ring....he uses the ring sometimes, but others when you think surely he will use it, its like he forgets he even has it in his pocket. Idk how this movie has an 8.4????? It deserves a 6 and be down the the B Rate movies, so hopefully more people will give a lower score so others don't waste their money. Which btw two tickets for 3D...29 dollars??? Movies like this will be the demise of the theater as I wont be giving Hollywood Directors my hard earned money for crap my 5 year old could put together better. You have been warned!! Don't see this movie, unless your one of the thousands of teenie boppers who obviously rated this too high and have no care for character development or plot.

VOMG! I'm speechless! Nothing from the book. NOTHING. Acting and plot? Well, if you've seen some Turkish or Korean soap-operas, they are better. Old communist-Chinese kung fu movies are better. The depths of the falsity of this film are impossible to describe. But because of it's horribleness, It's worth every penny I've spend on the ticket. This will enter the history as one of the worst movies ever made. The Hobbit 1 seems now like a Tati film, compared to this. A nightmare of bad taste and a run for money which defies any bit of common-sense. The action scenes are ridiculous. Legolas, riding on two dwarf heads, made me think about the Van Damme commercial (the one in which he rides between two trucks). The dragon, chasing the dwarfs for half an hour than abandoning the chase for a whim. Bard knowing already about the weak spot in the armour and being a descendant of the warrior who made that spot by shooting some special arrows at it... it kills any decency, really.

VThis film upset me so much I cried, right there in the cinema. I really am a huge Hobbit fan, I saw the first film 6 times in the cinema, I went to New Zealand just to see it and go on the Lord of the Rings tours, I have seen the Lord of the Rings films more times than I can possibly count. Trust me, I'm pretty mad about it all. Anyway, I loved the first Hobbit, I loved it for the parts they changed (artistic licence right?) and even more for the parts they kept. I certainly wasn't expecting to see the dwarfs wash the dishes and riddles in the dark blew my mind! This second installment left me feeling like someone had destroyed something I had been waiting for since I was 10. They hurried through the scenes from the book, changing everything they could and cutting huge chunks out. They made everything with CGI (even Legolas' horse. What, they couldn't afford a real horse?) and added as many characters as they could. They did all this so that the second half of the film could be taken up with completely fictitious battles against the Orcs and Smaug that never took place in the book. I don't understand. I thought Peter Jackson loved this book? Why would he want to change it all? Book aside, I thought there was too much action and no indication of the time passing. Everywhere the characters go is rushed through and the film would lead you to believe they just pottered over to the lonely mountain in a matter of days! It's probably great for action lovers, especially children who have never read the book and I hope that Peter Jackson inspires the next generation to fall in love with Tolkien but after the non stop roller-coaster that is this film, I think anyone reading the book for the first time would be confused and disappointed by how different the book really is. There was easily enough material for this film without adding so much new material, and the only way they could fit that new material was to remove and change the original story. I feel so sad, this can never be fixed. As a Tolkien fan, I feel this film is not 'The Hobbit' at all.

VI really enjoyed "The Trilogy of the Ring" and I liked reading "The Hobbit", so I was very disappointed when I saw "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013).\u000a\u000aThere is no compelling plot. There is no character development. The dialog is uninspired. There is not a single character who connects with the audience; or with any other character, for that matter. Gandalf appears at the beginning of the movie and then reappears at the end... he was missing throughout most of the movie.\u000a\u000aThe entire film consists of ugly orcs (they all look a lot alike) who are hypo-testosteroned half-wits who love fighting anything they see, even rocks. They're bulked up and covered with war paint and they have fearsome weapons. Fortunately, they are no match for two elves and an unarmed hobbit! Every fight scene looks like every other fight scene, which look like the worst fight scenes from the trilogy... swarming orcs somehow being defeated by the greatly-undermanned but truly-inspirational hobbit community.\u000a\u000aThe special effects are not bad.\u000a\u000aHere's the thing: Peter Jackson is running a scam on us. Groupies like me come running back and we contribute our money in the hope that we will see a good movie, hopefully even better than the trilogy. What we get is... (What? I can't say that?).\u000a\u000aYou might be able to watch this movie and enjoy it, if you prepare correctly. The first step would have to be liberal application of mind-numbing pharmaceuticals with optical enhancements. Then get someone to drive you to the theater, please.

VI feel bad that Peter Jackson is using JRR Tolkien's name to Market his movies. If He has some respect for the legend he should change the name of this trilogy. This movie is all about selling tickets. No respect for the original work. Let me point some of the outrageous things: 1.Beorn- a wise and fierce protector pictured as mindless beast 2. She Elf - that is a laughable plot. 3. Love triangle - Silly dramatic sequence. 4. Journey through mirkwood - main attraction of novel left out untold. 5. Elf King was pictured as evil who originally was kind and wise in the novel. These are few of the hundred points that I can write here. For me this movie was a kick in the guts.

VThe only emotion was boredom. At no time was I lost in the experience, thrilled see what would happen, how the action would unfold. This is worse than the first Hobbit movie, which was mediocre overall, but not nearly as terrible as this mess.\u000a\u000aI felt like I was watching someone else play a really bad fantasy video game.\u000a\u000aLook Ma! Watch me use technology with one hand tied behind my back to part people from their money by putting together an interminably long movie! The acting was robotic, probably due to the really poor script. The script was possibly written by a 12 year old, so maybe I shouldn't be so critical.\u000a\u000aThe entire feel was of something cobbled together out of separate pieces, resulting in a creature much like Frankenstein. A film not quite right, it has all the trappings of a much loved classic like LOTR or Star Wars. It falls far short. By the final scene, it stinks like a rotten cantaloupe, ripe for 20 minutes, quick to decay.\u000a\u000aThe action was simply idiotic in some places - going way too far into the fantastic.\u000a\u000aThe entire thing went downhill fast after Gandalf's Wizard Bomb in the fight against the Goblin King.\u000a\u000aThe amazing feats created for battle scenes of LOTR have morphed into super speed Cirque De Soleil - not at all thrilling, just boring.\u000a\u000aThe costumes were excellent.

VDon't know about Desolation of Smaug, I feel pretty desolate having watched that film. Had Peter Jackson ever read the book - a sweet little children's story? \u000a\u000aThe film leapt from one unrelated action sequence to another relentlessly with no concern for authenticity or continuity of story. Beheadings, stabbings, arrows through the eye and any amount of violence, but I guess they think it's OK because there was no sex or swearing. Then came the love interest between a Dwarf and Elf - What?!!!! (Mind you Aiden Turner is a suitable subject for a bit of love interest)\u000a\u000aWas that film really for children? No wonder kids grow up feeling confused - I feel confused now. (And another thing - why do people have to eat continuously while watching a film at the cinema - both hands stuffing face while eyes bulge.)\u000a\u000aOK that's my rant over, until I see another film that's an unmitigated disaster.

VBefore getting into the meat and bones of what I have to say about The Hobbit part 2 I'd like to point out that I'd be giving the film a 3/10 and be happy to leave it at that if it weren't for the extremely inappropriate use of 3D. It added no depth to any scene that could not have been accomplished with proper lighting and cinematography, it only served to distract and obfuscate as soon as anything moved across the screen. This pointless gimmick only ruins the experience.\u000a\u000aNow onto the actual film, saying it's no good is putting it lightly. The screenplay is an incoherent garbled mess that makes a mockery of the source work. Scene after scene we get to see characters we love and hold dear behaving inconsistently, hamming it up with lines that make you shake your head and wonder whoever thought it was a good idea to introduce a triangle drama for no discernible reason, among many major complaints. It's downright disrespectful how badly written this tripe is.\u000a\u000aAnd of course there's a whole bunch of completely unnecessary and needlessly drawn out action sequences shoehorned into the movie for no other purpose than filler. Legolas' nonsense athletic feats challenge the suspension of disbelief so frequently and so egregiously that eventually you just throw up your arms in the air and give up.\u000a\u000aWhat purpose is there to an action scene where you don't care for any of the characters? What tension is there when the bad guys are so ridiculously outmatched?\u000a\u000aAll this added action just ends up ruining the pacing because now you've got too many subplots going than you can reasonably allot time for.\u000a\u000aEven the audio is noticeably bad. The music from the LotR films will stay with me forever, the music playing over the end credits here just made me leave the theatre in haste.\u000a\u000aWell, at least Smaug was great, and we get a noticeably improved Bilbo this time around.

VI agree with most reviewer, that this is by far the worst movie so far, the elvish couple and kids-channel atmosphere destroys the many good and great scenes and creates and ambiguity that never leaves you. Also the fact that the whole atmosphere is gloomy does come through, but since the story line is so muddied up is fancy ninja elf-clowns fights it's hard to not feel cheated. I wanted to love and adore and worship this movie, instead I left hoping they would remake it and make it right..guess it was because they needed more money and had to make 3 films, so they invented some crap and put a bunch of kung-fu fighting elves in it after testing it on an audience of high school kids.

How many people can still be distracted by special effects? How many people out there will still settle for loud garbage? How many people are fed up and crave a little humanity, culture, meaning, and basic human decency when watching a film? I will say nothing more, numerous others have pointed out everything that is wrong with this picture. I just want to express my anger and contempt I feel not just for the filmmakers behind this project, but the entire contemporary film industry.

VAfter seeing the first part of THE HOBBIT I thought about catching the rest of the trilogy on DVD but having sometime off work and some money to spend I thought I'd treat myself to a visit to the cinema as a very special treat . I paid my money if only to escape the drudgery of a tough working week followed by a couple of lonely nights in my flat but didn't expect much from Peter Jackson whose creative stock seems to have utterly collapsed since RETURN OF THE KING \u000a\u000aTo be fair Jackson has made a darker and much better paced film to the first instalment that often manages to disguise how over extended the narrative is . Instead of the painfully repetitive story structure of being captured , escaping , being captured , escaping for the entire movie we actually often have engaging storytelling . I've never read the source novel and Tolkien junkies might hate any embellishment brought to the silver screen but the quest aspects are well done for the most part . The production have now concentrated on making THE HOBBIT a proper prequel to LORD OF THE RINGS as the Necromancer's power starts expanding planning extermination for Middle Earth . This subplot is developed via dual plotting where Gandalf leaves Bilbo's entourage and finds himself in danger . Bilbo and his comrades find they have problems of their own with constant danger all around them \u000a\u000aThe problem these dangers are often undermined by the production team who concentrate on spectacle rather than developing drama . A good example is where Bilbo and the dwarfs are cocooned by giant spiders which is a terrifying fate but is totally undermined by the arachnids being killed far too easily . This happens several times throughout the set pieces in the film where the good guys constantly defeat the bad guys so easily the audience quickly lose any sense of danger and adventure being involved . There's also a bit too much of the laws of physics being constantly broken . For example a fireball in a confined space would burn up all the surrounding oxygen and anyone nearby would suffocate but this fact is ignored and other implausible things involving science don't make the slightest sense . I know this features in many fantasy films , not least the original LOTR trilogy but it's been done to death and is very distracting . Compare the spectacular set pieces seen here to the battle scene seen in the departure of Boromir in FELLOWSHIP and you'll notice how overblown everything is in comparison here .\u000a\u000aIn summary this is fairly good film that is better than part one of THE HOBBIT . I say " fairly good " but when you compare it to LORD OF THE RINGS in general and FELLOWSHIP in particular ii is something of a backward step from the production team who brought us the original trilogy . That said I will probably pay money at the cinema to see the finale though more in hope rather than expectation

VEverything that i loved about the original trilogy is gone. How can one make such a bad movie... i don't even know what to say but everything is wrong with this movie, visual effects, direction and story. If you have read the book you will be disappointed. The movie has loss of balance, too much action and no character development. Legolas wasn't even in the book neither was Tauriel which Peter Jackson came up with. The dragon was cool though but that is all i can say i liked about the movie. Two hobbit movies would have been enough to tell the story from the book, i mean just look at the harry potter movies compared to the books, they are just brilliant. The movie is brainless and rushed which is a shame as i've been so excited for the "The Hobbit Movies". I really hope the last one is made with care because it really deserves it.

VThis movie was a slap in the face to Tolkien and his book. The movie diverges so far from the story that real fans of the book will be outraged. Characters and plot are added at random and certain elements from the book are altered for no conceivable reason. Aside from it's terrible representation of the book it is not a very good movie. Some scenes are even filmed with a go-cam. The CG can be bad at times and the action is filled with over-the-top antics. If you want a mindless break from reality then go see this atrocity. If you are looking for a proper retelling of the book then stay away. Some of us have been waiting for years for this movies and Peter Jackson has strayed so far from the masterpiece that was The Lord of the Rings.

VI loved the book The Hobbit. One of the best parts of the book is Bilbo outsmarting the Dragon to show it's weak spot. My Heart Sank as I watch the best parts of the Book Rewriten into nothingness. Peter Jackson seems to have to respect for the books that he is translating into movies. All I can say after Lord of the Rings and now the Hobbit is that Peter Jackson's goal was to rewrite and change These beloved story's.\u000a\u000aI was very disappointed by this movie. I doubt I'll bother to watch the last one.\u000a\u000aSo Sad! So Sad!! :(

VMy wife and I saw it tonight with my teenage girls and a nice friend who paid for us all and I can honestly say that it was worse than a waste of his money - even our daughters who read the book said it was terrible - lots of things that were not in the book included, lots of (good) things that were in the book removed and super intense violence and death from beginning to end. I went for a walk outside part way through after the 50th head was chopped off in battle. As we watched it in 3-D Imax, to me, it was like being inside a very violent video game without all the quaint parts that Tolkien had in his book, removed.\u000a\u000aIf it is not as successful as they hope in sales then they might return to the actual story as written by Tolkien in Part 3, instead of reveling in 2 hours of humourless gore (no, Al was not in it, but it was bad nonetheless).\u000a\u000aTom

VMAJOR SPOILERS: I loved The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. I loved it because, despite straying from the story some, it captured all the characters and the most important scenes perfectly. This changed a LOT though in the next one. \u000a\u000aOf course, we have the same great actors that everyone loves, but watching the movie makes you wonder if Peter Jackson read the book at all. Absolutely none of what happened in this movie was like the book. Now I liked how they added the elves, but making them show up everywhere and constantly saving the day was ridiculous. Also, they added in a big story with Bard helping the dwarfs, which I wouldn't have minded if they done this part terribly. Gandalf's battle with the Necromancer and the Orcs would've been good if it wasn't so slow and drawn out, and it made it worse that they stuck these scenes in the middle of Bilbo in the Dragon's cave, which made you just waiting for Gandalf to be done.\u000a\u000aNow I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought Fili and Kili were the best dwarfs, and then Jackson went and took them out of the whole second part of the movie! They stayed in Laketown while everyone else went to battle the dragon. There was also a romance triangle between Legolas, Tauriel, and . . . Kili.\u000a\u000aOK, I'm done ranting about what they added in. Now for a short part where I rant about what they didn't.\u000a\u000aI think I can speak for all hobbit fans when I say that, aside from Bilbo's convo with Gollum (riddles in the dark), Bilbo's convo with the dragons and the spiders were probably the best parts of the book. And they took BOTH of these parts out! I spent a lot of the movie anticipating Bilbo's encounter with Smaug, and they botched it. The only thing they seemed interested in was having the dragon fly around blasting fire and knocking over the pillars, and also making him look stupid while trying to catch the dwarfs and the hobbit. OK, I'm not gonna pretend the dragon didn't look cool. But looks is about all he had. He was slow, clumsy, and not at all clever like in the book.\u000a\u000aONE LAST COMPLAINT: Does anyone agree that Beorn's scene in the book was possibly the funniest? Well it didn't happen. All they did is made him look like a scary jerk, and again they were more interested in making this looking like an action scene rather than the funny, witty scene it was supposed to be.\u000a\u000aThe only reason I gave this movie any stars was because 1. I love the characters, and 2. The movie had great visuals. No matter how bad they did the spider scene, it still looked cool, and no matter how bad a character Smaug was, the treasure room was gorgeous. Thanks for reading.

VIt was Christmas Eve, and in the end, I decided I'd rather spend the rest of the evening with the animals than endure another minute of THIS. It was only the Exit door that gave me relief from this mess of a film.\u000a\u000aMy wife was visiting family abroad, and I had to work the remainder of the week. As such, I thought I'd take advantage of a smaller Xmas Eve crowd than that found on a usual night for the latest "blockbuster." It was a decent plan, but ultimately, a big waste of money and time. In the end, I found that the warmth and companionship of a loyal German Shepherd mix and a small cat trumped spending another second in this pap of a film.\u000a\u000aAlthough having read the books at some point in the past, I am not a purist with regard to interpretation onto the big screen. The films of the LOTR's trilogy was well-done, and the first Hobbit was tolerably good, in spite of some added characters and sequences that detracted form the film.\u000a\u000aThis, however, was beyond the line in terms of what I could endure. To condense this without similar pap I'll just bullet the following:\u000a\u000a1) The story was lost. I just wanted it to end at whatever point was chosen by the director, but it never did - and this was at the 2 hr mark at which I just couldn't take it anymore. \u000a\u000a2) There were multiple fabricated story lines that weren't part of the book, and which did not add to a better film story, either. Rarely, I would detect a thread of truth to the original story - and actually, those were good. That said, it was only a small percentage of the film that contained these - certainly less than 20-25% of it. And, the parts that did support the core story were rushed. Character development was nonexistent. I did not give a flying care for any of the characters by the time I finally extracted myself from the torture of sitting through this. \u000a\u000a3) The first installment was truer to the story than this by far. Perhaps two movies would have sufficed? One well done film would have been preferable.\u000a\u000aI suppose the writers and director intended to use this to build more foundational depth to the LOTR, but "The Hobbit" was completely lost, and the "depth" turned out to be a load of Cheese Whiz on a saltine cracker. Against the occasional Tolkein dialogs, the screenwriters' work appeared as 8-year-olds writing for 8-year-olds. Truly horrid.\u000a\u000aAt least it is over. I'll not spend a dime to see the third part, unless it is through my Netflix subscription.

VLike many other creations coming out of Hollywood today, with over the top special effects and cheesy love stories, so is the movie "the desolation of Smaug" a poor attempt to make a good film, trying to dazzle the audience with cheesy triangle-dramas, ridiculous special effects and silly additions to the original story. A book that's fantastic by the way.\u000a\u000aThe first one was disappointing and the second one was horrible. And i do compare the books of Tolkien in real life so i will compare this movie to LOTR. And i really like the LOTR adaptations from the books, but Bilbo don't even come close to Peters first adventure. He has walked trough the door to plastic Hollywood world on these Bilbo movies, when he only had his foot in the last time he created the LOTR movies.\u000a\u000aThe new(and old) characters are poorly written in, and takes away light from the dwarfs and Bilbos journey. So you kinda loose interest in what is happening to Bilbo because they're cutting fourth and back between these many add-ons to the story and Bilbo.\u000a\u000a3/10

VSorry! But I've lost my patience! Watching The Hobbit was quite demoralizing! Unfortunately, The Hobbit has been turned into a commodity like toothpaste and underarm deodorant! There is ZERO justification for turning the Hobbit into a trilogy, if you are going to drag out the story and do such a poor job. The Tolkien family - who I assume controls the rights to J.R.R. Tolkien's works - should be ashamed of themselves.They could have insisted in putting the story first instead of letting director Jackson create such a vapid and mediocre second Hobbit film. It's really quite sad! How can a director who made 3 masterpieces out of Lord of the Rings stoop so low and turn The Hobbit into something so trite and empty that, at times, it's like watching a Saturday morning breakfast cereal commercial on T.V.? \u000a\u000aI badly wanted to like this movie. At least the first movie of The Hobbit trilogy had some interesting moments despite its many flaws. But now the Hobbit has been turned into a cartoon with mostly boring two-dimensional, cardboard characters. The acting was so poor at times it ruined the illusion. But worst of all, there's very little heart, unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is the epitome of passion and adventure and good storytelling.\u000a\u000aI also think part of the problem is that director Jackson is trying to turn The Hobbit into another The Lord of the Rings, which is quite stupid. They are very different stories. From what I have read, Tolkien wrote The Hobbit essentially for fun and wasn't even going to have it published until his friend, the great writer, C. S. Lewis convinced him otherwise. The Tolkien family should have went with a different director. Since when does one man own a storytelling giant like Tolkien? \u000a\u000aThen I was forced to watch this awful movie in 3D or drive elsewhere. I noticed about 30 seconds of special 3D affects. How can that be called a 3D movie? I call it a rip-off and I wish the Federal government would call such a claim fraud, so filmmakers would think twice about ripping off the public! \u000a\u000aHollywood pulled the same stretching-out-the-story-stunt with Harry Potter, but at least I was smart enough to never have watched the last film. I eventually became so disgusted, I could care less what happened to Harry Potter. The same storytelling destruction non-sense has now captured the Hobbit. When I started hoping that Smaug would snap Bilbo Baggins and the King of the Dwarfs in a half, I realized I'm now done with all things Hobbit movie related!!

VThis is not a movie for devoted Tolkien fans. Or even for true fans of "The Hobbit." This is Peter Jackson's fan-fiction "re-imagining" of Tolkien's first book. He's known for taking liberties with the source material. It worked well 90% of the time in the extended editions of the LOTR films. But the reverse is true with this prequel series (so far.) His changes and additions are jarring, annoying, and pointless.\u000a\u000aLike Lucas with his digital tools at ILM, Jackson has taken the Weta CGI SpFX and turned Middle Earth into a cheesy theme park full of action rides for adolescents. The overuse of 3D computer graphics in place of actual real-life sets and characters resembles a Pixar cartoon more than a fantasy-adventure epic. The orcs and villains in LOTR looked solid and believable. They were played by actors on-set. In The Hobbit, the goblins, trolls and orcs are video game characters with no substance. It's a shame what can happen when directors like Jackson, Lucas and Shyamalan, who held such promise, are given carte-blanche and huge budgets to feed their inflated egos. They lose all restraint and the ability to edit themselves. Every crazy idea is implemented. Nothing is too far-fetched or ridiculous. \u000a\u000aIf you thought some action sequences in King Kong (2005) went overboard and on screen for too long – the dinosaur stampede being an example – that's nothing compared to what Desolation of Smaug has in store. It's mostly one implausible, dizzying roller-coaster ride after another. I'm all for thrill-rides, but enough is enough. At some point you need a break from the constant camera shots weaving in and out, up and down ad infinitum. Loses its impact after the first 4 minutes, then proceeds to make you nauseated or bored, or both. Whatever happened to story, character development, and emotional involvement? Marginalized in favor of Saturday morning cartoon fare. Battle sequences galore.\u000a\u000aBy now, my initial joy at hearing that PJ had taken the reins of The Hobbit has been replaced with a regret that it wasn't directed by the first choice, Guillermo del Toro. He could not possibly have ruined it any worse than Jackson. Did somebody pull a switcheroo on us – exchange the fat, talented PJ for this new thin hack masquerading as the guy who gave us the beautiful LOTR trilogy?

VI would never normally watch a film of this genre, let alone review it, but I had a soft spot for the LOTR films (and the book of the Hobbit... never liked the LOTR books), and enjoyed the first Hobbit film. Well! This film is a perfect manifestation of why American (and I mean that in terms of the capitalism-inspired film factory rather than the nationality) cinema is risible and pathetic. Here's a list of why: 1) Awful CGI throughout. Not a single shot doesn't look like some sort of teenage boy's x-box wet dream. 2) Terrible, boring dialogue. I neither understood, nor cared about, what the hell anyone was talking about or the apparent "plot". 3) The film consists of: dwarfs run to a huge set piece and are besieged by CGI baddies, none of which are remotely original; dwarfs run to another massive set piece (all of which look like some sort of fantasy mini-golf world or look like they've been stolen from earlier films such as Pan's Labyrinth). 4) Pisspoor acting all round. Even Sir Ian is over-acting, probably trying to lend some sort of gravitas to this cash cow. 5) Crap music: couldn't be arsed to come up with anything new? 6) Whatever this new HFR thing is meant to be, it looks AWFUL. The heightened colours only serve to make everything look like plastic. This is expounded by the constant use throughout the film of the swirly filter akin to something from Photoshop. Zzzzzzz.\u000a\u000aI actually gave up concentrating when someone said "Yeah, I told him to go..(something in Elvish... "get a real job" perhaps?). This reminded me of the "Game Over" line in one of the LOTR films: totally out of place and designed to make the film appeal to morons. STOP FUNDING THIS RUBBISH! Put the money to better use.

VBy presenting just a handful of illustrations, I'll explain why this movie is no fun for anyone, unless you're a four year old.\u000a\u000aLet's start off by saying that I'm not considering the books here, or how accurate the movies are. I'm just in it for the way overdone Peter Jackson Hollywood experience.\u000a\u000aHaving said that, this movie stinks. It makes very little sense, plus it looks like crap. Here's why.\u000a\u000a1. Legolas' magic robot horse - First of all, there's the Legolas vs. bald orc leader boy who looks like Angela Merkel supposedly epic boss battle scene. The two get into what has to be the most uninteresting fight in Peter Jackson history. However, luckily for the viewers, it's over quite soon as the bald Merkel dude decides he's got better things to do and rides away on a warg. This makes sense when you consider the fact that the area was crawling with troops of orcs on wargs. But then, out of nowhere, Legolas ends up on the back of a golden boy horse in hot pursuit of Merkelboy. So first off, where on earth did this magic horse come from (and why don't I have one)? But most importantly, PJ includes this 'cool' Legolas on horse filmed from the front shot, portraying Legolas as the hair in the wind hero saving the day, but the only thing you can really look at in that particular scene is a horse that looks like a robot on steroids. Swingin' a miss, PJ.\u000a\u000a2. Look, behind you - I'm almost embarrassed to say this, but you know the classic Hollywood trick where the bad guy almost catches and finishes off the good guy but then someone comes around the corner and yells "Hey bad guy, I'm behind you" and then the bad guy turns around and forgets what he was doing and leaves the good guy to run off and save the day? PJ must love that convenient little trick because it's in this film as well. And the funniest part is that when the distracting group of dwarfs calls out Smaug to turn around, they are at the opposite end of a huge hollowed out mountain and, in fact, in no position to harm him or do anything important to help the group of dwarfs that Smaug was after in the first place – unless, of course, distracting Smaug and having their friends run off. So, our cute villain dragon has absolutely no reason to turn his attention to the distracting group, but of course he does because PJ can't do anything right in this movie.\u000a\u000a3. Lame go pro action - In what can only be described as the most nonsensical scene in Hollywood history, the cheeky dwarfs (who look like regular sized people in 90% of the movie) work their way around their enemies by floating down a river in barrels, all the while filming their nerdy action with go pro cameras attached to the barrels (go pro cams, really PJ?). They have neatly lined up the exact number of barrels to fit every dwarf. Then, after the most unbelievable scene of a dwarf jumping from riverbank to riverbank and killing an entire army of orcs just by rolling over them in his barrel, he decides he wants to get back in the water with his dwarf friends and so he jumps back into the river without even looking. As it turns out, even though there was only one barrel per dwarf just one minute ago, out of magical nowhere, an empty barrel ended up floating between the other dwarfs. Needless to say, the jumping action dwarf lands right into it without a scratch (even though, as anyone knows who ever tried to jump into an inflatable ring when he was a kid, this is the hardest thing to ever pull off). Where did that barrel come from and how often has the dwarf practiced jumping into inflatable rings as a kid? And since when are there inflatable rings in the Dwarf regions of Middle Earth?\u000a\u000a4. Smaug's to do list - OK spoiler up ahead: this is about the movie's ending. So, the seven dwarfs are facing Smaug and undo this huge golden dwarf statue from its rocky prison. Then, as the gold melts (which, as all the streams of gold in the movie by the way, looks like a milkshake gone bad), it covers Smaug and, oh heavens no, Smaug is hurt and angry. However, just before this happened, Smaug had decided to fly over to some village to release his reign of terror. This makes sense, because even fire breathing dragons need activities to fill the day. But, at this point he had just been attacked and put through this cozy looking, but certainly life threatening golden shower. So shouldn't he be angry and like, attack the seven dwarfs and their Aragorn rip off leader, who, by the way, is hanging in mid air right in front of Smaug. I mean, in one five-second move he could easily wipe out all these dwarfs. For instance, he could pick up a rock from the huge pile in front of him and throw it at them. Or he could, you know, use his fire spewing abilities. But none of that, because Smaug has a to do list to attend to, so he leaves the dwarfs behind (amid all his treasures and riches - !!) and just flies off. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\u000a\u000a5. Legolas is the coolest guy in the movie even though Legolas is in fact the suckiest character in film history, you know, always ending up in scenes he doesn't belong in, staring off into the distance.\u000a\u000aIn short, this movie is stupendous and you should not waste your time watching it. Ever.

VThe Hobbit is a simple and straightforward children's book about finding a dragon, killing it and going back home. How can you possibly mess that up when you start making a film adaptation with abundant resources? Well, let me tell you how they managed.\u000a\u000aPoor J.R.R. Tolkien, he's probably spinning wildly in his grave right now. The man that you could with justification call an absolute perfectionist when it comes to the presentation of his work would have never approved of this silly bore fest. Honestly, during some of the fight scenes I was expecting Graham Chapman as Colonel to come on to the screen and tell us exactly how silly it was that we just saw. "An Unexpected Journey" was promising enough to assume that the trilogy would probably not be a complete flop after all, but "Desolation of Smaug" is where everything goes wrong. There's little left to redeem in the end.\u000a\u000aOK, the bottom of the barrel first, fight scenes. In Lord of the Rings trilogy fight scenes passed two critical tests: they were (at least if you exclude Legolas) somewhat realistic, and they served a purpose from the viewpoint of the story. Here, we have none of that. Legolas is back with sillier stunts than ever but that's not all. This time, EVERYONE is doing silly stunts, except the orcs of course, who are there solely to get hit, usually in the groin by an axe that has just passed through several pairs of hands of dwarfs that are going down rapids in bouncing, shaky barrels that somehow refuse to sink despite taking in water all the time. Another thing: whenever a central character is threatened in any way, you'll soon learn to ask yourself two questions: which part of the baddies' body is the arrow going to pierce, and who will shoot it? \u000a\u000aNeed I even talk about the absurd love story between one of the dwarfs and the elven warrior played by Evangeline Lily? It's probably enough if I say it's one of the most forced and implausible love stories ever put on screen. Besides from this romance that kick starts immediately without a viable reason, everything in this movie is so drawn out and slow that Bilbo's quote from Lord of the Rings fits perfectly. You wait and wait for something meaningful to happen, and when it finally does. It. Goes. On. For. Ages. There are good things as well, most notably Martin Freeman does good job as Bilbo and Benedict Cumberbatch is phenomenal as the voice of Smaug. Unfortunately, with a script like this even talented actors can only do so much.\u000a\u000aThe script. Oh god, the script. I refuse to talk about it. If watching the movie was this painful, how awful must it have been to actually write something so boring? All in all, this movie is bad. Really, really bad. It's not because the crew and cast don't know what they're doing, it's because they're doing too much of everything just to squeeze out as much money as possible from source material that would've been enough for one feature film and no more. Also, the spirit of the source material is forgotten. This is no kids' movie, this is a movie that tries its earnest to be Lord of the Rings without ever having a chance to achieve that goal.\u000a\u000aA friendly word of advice to you Peter Jackson: since you clearly wanted to make a movie trilogy that was like LotR, start filming Silmarillion next. There's enough gritty source material for ten movies for you there, and it's all action if you so wish. Drop the silliness you have brought in in The Hobbit though.

VHaving really enjoyed An Unexpected Journey, though it was a long way from perfect, last year, a family cinema outing for this was guaranteed. And it was worth the wait, Dad and I liked it a little less than my brother, sister and godparents(die-hard LOTR and Hobbit fans by the way) but all of us found a lot to enjoy, more so than An Unexpected Journey. Desolation of Smaug also shares imperfections, Azog is still a very one-dimensional villain and doesn't add a lot to the story(Bolg is no better either actually); the love triangle felt forced and shoe-horned in for the sake of it, including a bit that is like an inferior copy of Arwen and Arogorn; Beorn is criminally underused and any signs of development with him is rushed; the Mirkwood scene is far too short though the atmosphere was good; Gandalf deserved more to do with only his encounter with Sauron and perhaps the beginning really standing out for him; and the ending is very abrupt with a pointless, too long and really overly-silly battle between Smaug and the dwarfs(Smaug's final line was incredibly chilling though!).\u000a\u000aMoving on from the debits, the film does look amazing. I liked that we saw more locations and that the film has a softer, darker yet more storybook-like feel to it than An Unexpected Journey. The attention to detail in the costumes, make-up and sets(Laketown is fantastic) is remarkable, the photography is beautifully transitioned and atmospheric and most of the special effects are great, especially with Smaug, Sauron and the spiders and excepting the flowing gold and maybe Azog. The music in equal turn is ethereal and haunting, not the most memorable stuff that Howard Shore has written but it fits perfectly within the film. The script has a better balance between the comedic and dramatic, in fact the humour is subtle while taking much more of a serious approach than to An Unexpected Journey without being too morose. It's thought-provoking too, and Smaug's lines especially in his taunting of Bilbo and when Bilbo implores him from not attacking Laketown are just chilling.\u000a\u000aThe story gets much more to the point than in An Unexpected Journey and the pacing is swifter with generally more dramatic tension(if not always consistent). There are some great set pieces too, Bilbo's encounter with Smaug is the highlight of the film, tense and brilliantly written, though the spider scene is appropriately sticky and matches it in tension, Gandalf's encounter with Sauron was brief but visually stunning and the barrel-on-the-river scene while on the over-exaggerated side is a lot of fun, inventive and thrilling. The acting is good, Martin Freeman is still appealing in a curmudgeon sense, Ian McKellen is still perfect as Gandalf(even doing things that you do not expect someone of his age to still do, but he should have had more to do), Richard Armitage is a brooding presence and succeeds in showing Thorin's worse qualities and Ken Stott stands out among the dwarfs, he is fun and wise here. Orlando Bloom has some charisma, Lee Pace plays the morally ambiguous character of Thranduil just right(he does come across as a douche but from a moral perspective he is an interesting character) and the astonishingly beautiful Evangeline Lilly brings some real heart as the most likable character of the film.\u000a\u000aStephen Fry chews the scenery amusingly, Sylvester McCoy does respectably with Radagast wisely being given a backseat and Bard is well played. The best asset of the film though is Smaug. Right from his design, the best-looking dragon design since that for Dragonslayer. To how cunning, manipulative and physically mighty he is. And to Benedict Cumberbatch's(one of the most talented actors to date) booming, sly, sinister and really quite phenomenal voice-work in definitely the most evil role he has done to date. The film absolutely nails the scene between Bilbo and Smaug, and Smaug and Cumberbatch have much to thank for that, as well as the writing being the best it is. While the film is not faithful at all really to Tolkein's The Hobbit apart from some details- it's often more Lord of the Rings-feeling(though not as good) than The Hobbit- the first half of the scene between Bilbo and Smaug does show clear evidence of fidelity, with the dialogue almost straight out of the book.\u000a\u000aOverall, judging it as a stand-alone- which in all honesty it deserves to be, one of those things that I'm getting sick of repeating but it's necessary because of how much of a problem it seems to be(not quite as bad as people having no regard for other people's opinions and making out they're the only ones that are right, there's a lot going on here too)- The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug was a flawed but very entertaining film and superior to its predecessor from personal opinion. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox

V...he rewrote the story, and he failed miserably.\u000a\u000aAll the substance and the beauty of the book, cut out, and replaced with mindless, fast moving action scenes, - which we could see in any silly Hollywood action movie. How sad.\u000a\u000aNew characters, dialogs and plot twists are introduced constantly. Existing characters (those from the actual book) are bastardized and dumb down to the level, where there're hardly recognizable, and impossible to relate to.\u000a\u000aI couldn't wait for the movie to end, and left cinema disappointed, almost in disbelieve that what I saw, was actually The Hobbit. The first part wasn't too bad, and it could be a nice trilogy, like the LOTR was, but I'm afraid this one, ruined the whole thing. I have no desire whatsoever to see the third one.

VWhere can I begin with the "superlatives" of how poor this film is? Way way too long, scant reference to the books (Considering the ONLY reason these stories are so popular was because of the strength of the writing!) a ridiculous and crass "love" story. Add the criminal under use of Martin Freeman and the "crimes" against Tolkien start to add up!\u000a\u000aNo question the effects are stunning, but with technology as it is, even films with smaller budgets can have great CGI nowadays. Having stunning graphics simply isn't good enough any more! For the Tolkien purists they will be horrified to what they have done with the book. Seems film writers think they know the hobbit better than Tolkien - THEY ARE WRONG! No question people will watch this in their droves, and no question the final film will get a huge following. All I can hope for is that the final film is better than this, because this film STINKS

VThe switching between CGI and non CGI shots was painful at times (The river scene with barrels specifically, flashing between overhead CGI shots and point of view shots from inside the barrel that were live action was a joke. Also the title screen looked like it was from 1985. The rest of the movie was simply long and uneventful with too many attempts at "ah-ha" moments instead of quality (The naming of Sting was as cheap as you can get). And the attempted jokes/humor were abysmal failures. If you try to compare it to any of the LOTR movies you just can't. It is an entirely different movie, has none of the same feel and isn't nearly as good. But Leaving it to stand on it's own it still fails miserably. Exact quotes heard while leaving the theater "Well that was a colossal waste of time" and "that felt more like a Red Box exclusive type of movie"

VI am at a loss for words. I love everything Middle Earth, have read most everything Tolkien ever put into print. I absolutely adored the Lord of the Rings Trilogy that Jackson brought us a decade ago. There were some changes made to those movies which upset this purist, but I fully understand that the big screen requires conversions and tweaks here and there. There were some unnecessary additions but all in-all kept true to the story.\u000a\u000aI was quite disappointed by "An Unexpected Journey" last year, but at the very least that move seemed to *resemble* the book. I was willing to overlook Jackson's liberal adaptation as a one-time fluke. I mean, this movie was a Peter Jackson film...certainly the changes were done out of necessity? Right? In retrospect I think Jackson anticipated this blind loyalty to turn a profit when he chose to re-write these stories.\u000a\u000a"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" can only be considered the Tolkien tale in the most general of sense. The names of characters and places are the same, there was a forest (briefly) and some spiders, a mountain and a dragon, but the similarities to the tale we know and love end there. I feel lied to. The movie was entitled "The Hobbit", which is false advertising and if we were talking about any other product or service would carry legal implications for deceptive marketing.\u000a\u000aThis all being said, maybe I'm just mad because I'm a Tolkien purist, but maybe not. The movie wasn't even good as a movie by another name. The story was jumpy and disjointed, downright boring in places (30 minutes of Smaug flapping around inside the mountain, some scheme involving ineffective but hastily made bombs, and molten gold? What?) and CG effect quality that might have (barely) passed muster on a mid-day Sci Fi Channel feature.\u000a\u000aI gave the movie a 2 out of 10 because I feel that the bulk of the acting was well done. Special kudos to Freeman, Nesbitt, and McKellan, but for some reason Legolas seemed paper-thin.\u000a\u000aI saw all of the LotR movies and "An Unexpected Journey" at the midnight showing. Because of "An Unexpected Journey" I saw "The Desolation of Smaug" on opening weekend. Because of "The Desolation of Smaug" I might watch "There and Back Again" when I comes out on cable.\u000a\u000aSo I find myself right where I was ten years ago when the screen went dark on "Return of the King"...hoping that someday in the future someone will step up and make a movie version of "The Hobbit".

VI got back from seeing the midnight premiere of The Desolation of Smaug. In all honesty, I thought the movie, down to its core, was bad.\u000a\u000aI came into it with pretty subdued expectations, having not taken well to the previous installment An Unexpected Journey (2012), but TDOS reached a new low. This is probably Peter Jackson's weakest directorial effort, even more so than the disastrous Lovely Bones.\u000a\u000aThe movie is essentially a CGI cartoon, implementing laugh out loud action sequences and special effects. The pacing is sluggish and disjointed. About 30 minutes in, I found myself taken out of the experience completely, trying to guess where the movie would end.\u000a\u000aMartin Freeman gives another wonderful performance as Bilbo Baggins, but is severely underused, being more or less shuffled into the fold of events.\u000a\u000aAesthetically, it is hard to believe that this movie is grounded in the same Middle Earth seen in Jackson's Lord of The Rings trilogy. This interpretation of Middle Earth is bright, and lacks physical depth and any sort of fantasy realism. Visually, it looks like a very unfortunate mixture of the film adaptations of Eragon and Narnia.\u000a\u000aLike the last time around, the 48 frame rate is hyper-realistic, looking like an uncanny set piece or a feverish soap opera. Most of the CGI effects are pretty poor, I don't want to give anything away, but there is a sequence with molten liquid that looks like Nintendo water.\u000a\u000aThis movie amplified everything I didn't like about the previous installment: poor pacing, fabricated and exaggerated content, cheesy imagery, and a lack of practical effects (particularly with creatures and miniatures).\u000a\u000aIt seems that this Hobbit trilogy is being executed as an artificial prequel to The Lord of The Rings, full of ominous forebodings that amount to little more than painful nods and familiar musical cues. The events of The Hobbit are almost incidental to the story, which is a real shame, particularly for people just being introduced to Tolkien and Middle Earth, it's a gross misrepresentation.\u000a\u000aThere were some good things, like the design and performance of Smaug, but overall, this movie was a real bummer.

VI just watched The Desolation of Smaug for the first time since I saw it and disliked it in theaters. It's still highly unlikeable. The entire movie is such a weird paradox. So bloated yet so anemic. So flashy and chaotic yet so utterly boring. The most important and weighty scenes play out like cartoons while the silliest, most contrived nonsense (like the Kili/Tauriel love story) is excruciatingly played out and takes itself far too seriously. \u000a\u000aBeyond these problems, the film is clumsy in its pacing and has no flow to speak of. There's no structure, no rising action, climax or descending action; just stuff happening. Smaug feels like an afterthought when the film finally makes it to him, and beyond his cool design and Benedict's fantastic voice work he's a total failure. There's no sense of danger with him, no foreboding or menace. He practically plays tag with the dwarfs in a ludicrously silly action sequence that serves no purpose. Then the movie just ends. It's confusing and a bit pathetic. \u000a\u000aThe film does feature some nice bits of cinematography and Smaug does have his cool moments, but beyond that this is nothing more than a shameless cash grab that feels more and more irreverent to Tolkien with each passing minute. I despise the fans who demand that a film adaptation hold strictly to the novel, but "Desolation" is in a league of it's own where films seem to go out of their way to disregard and tarnish everything the novel set out to do in the first place. It's a lousy movie made by a now-lousy director.

VIt starts with an opening scene that is so awkward it is almost comical - but not in the ironic, fun way. In the "did I get in to the wrong movie?" way. It was like watching Scary Movie when you thought you were sitting down to watch Scream.\u000a\u000aIt didn't stop there, though. Despite being incredibly long, the movie has almost no character development, and aside from Bilbo, none of the characters are at all likable. I went with friends that were big fans (and I was also a big fan) - and we all equally disliked just about every single one of the dwarfs. So much more could have been done with them, but instead they acted as props for the entire movie... moving props, yes, but still props.\u000a\u000aNow to the absolutely, positively, worst element of the movie. HFR 3D. OMG, I really hope this goes extinct, and fast. I love 3D, and it is the only reason I go to movies in the theater anymore - but this HFR stuff makes it obvious that you are looking at a bunch of guys in makeup on a badly assembled set. I felt like I was watching a high-school play the entire time. I understand that HFR improves the way that sports look - but movies are vastly different. Movies need the soft edges and warmth that *film* provides. Movies need to let me escape into their world and enjoy the story. There wasn't a single moment during this movie that I felt like I was part of the story. Please, please let this medium die. I thought it was just me, but at the end of the movie my friends turned to me and asked "Why did the movie look so bad?" I explained about HFR to them and they said "Well, guess we aren't going to waste money going to the movies anymore."\u000a\u000aAnd that's exactly what you would be doing if you saw this movie in the theaters.

VI am a big Fan of Tolkien's work. While Peter Jackson's "adaptations" have all disappointed me, I still owned them all. I am willing to allow for necessary changes to translate a story onto the big screen, when done tastefully. However, as Peter Jackson's success feeds his ego, we see less and less of anything tasteful in his work.\u000a\u000aFor fans of The Professor and his work, the sad state of this movie can be summed up easily: were you to remove Tolkien's character and place names from this movie, they could have bygone purchasing the movie rights and still avoided copyright infringement lawsuits. \u000a\u000aWhile there are a few scenes very roughly based upon the book (i.e. there are barrels, and there is a dragon), none of these scenes plays out in such a way that I personally would have recognized as being based on The Hobbit. The Sword of Shannara actually bears a greater resemblance to Tolkien's work than this movie which abuses the name and idea of middle earth.\u000a\u000aFor other sentient beings, you need know only that this movie has stunning visuals, a little eye-candy for the ladies, and little else going for it. \u000a\u000aPeter Jackson either has no attention-span of his own, or he expects none from his viewers. If I ever actually watch this movie again, I will literally use a stop watch to see if I can ever reach one minute without some ridiculous, artificial, played-up conflict, superficially added to the plot for no reason beyond immediate suspense for its own sake. In other words, cheap manipulation of the audience. All else, including internal consistency, is sacrificed to this false god.\u000a\u000aWhile the movie's predecessor bent the laws of physics, The Desolation of Smaug ignores or destroys them. Parts of the movie bear so little scrutiny that they transport you out of the scene (if you were actually engaged in it before) and into an epic face-palm. \u000a\u000aThe action is over-the-top, as is PJ's usual. The real problem with Jackson's action scenes is that nobody can really worry about the safety of the characters; every one of them is portrayed as a Last Action Hero that Schwarzenegger himself would be proud of. \u000a\u000aI knew that I would be disappointed going into this movie. My expectations were very low. As low as my expectations were, I still left so angry that I couldn't sleep.\u000a\u000aAll I can say now to Peter Jackson now is: NO! No, no, no! Keep your hands off both Tolkien and movies.

VI'll try to make this as spoiler free as possible.\u000a\u000aAfter reading all the books, The hobbit, and The LOTR trilogy I then watched the films. To begin with the LOTR was as close to perfection as you can come when talking about movie adaptations. So having said that, I was disappointed that the Hobbit was going to be made into a trilogy but lets not dwell on that or we will be here all day. Now this or should I say these movies the unexpected journey included just takes all that good work and throws it all away.\u000a\u000aThere is never a point in this film where there is a sense of danger, all the heroes are action stars, they never get hurt (apart from Kili with the poison arrow) but even then you know he's going to be alright. If your good then your invincible, but if your bad you are just cannon fodder that can't shoot straight. This just make's you not care about the characters and ultimately the whole film.\u000a\u000aWell done Peter Jackson for making a great book into an awful Film.

VMajor spoiler At the end of the film Bilbo looks into the camera and says "What have we done?" Never a truer word has been spoken by a fictitious character about the film he is starring in. This is NOT The Hobbit. The second movie (and I thought it was bad enough when I thought there were only two films) is Peter Jackson's attempt at writing Tolkien and it fails miserably. Furthermore, some reviewers have mentioned Smaug as if he single handedly saves the movie. He does not. Instead I sat there wondering why he hadn't burnt the burglar and the dwarfs instead of talking to them on and on, obviously to stretch the movie out. The biggest mystery now is how will Mr Jackson come up with enough plot for another movie? Maybe Smaug will do a lot more talking?

VThis is not the Hobbit, this is a film based very loosely on the book by Tolkien. Lots of action scenes added for no other reason but to stretch the films out. They have changed major plot lines of the book and I cannot see for what reason except but to detract from what was a masterpiece. The Story of Beorn the skin changer was completely messed up and destroyed, the Mirkwood scenes was also a complete mess and missed the target by miles. Dwarfs fighting Smaug within the lonely mountain....what's that all about?? Some of the dwarfs staying in the village and fighting Orcs?? Elves fighting dwarfs and Orcs during the barrel ride?? Elves fighting Orcs in the lake town?? Was there some addition to the story behind all these added fighting scenes, they lost all of Tolkien's important and legendary story telling ability with this movie. Also some of the movie looked so unreal I don't know why they didn't just make the entire film animated.\u000a\u000aThey lost the entire feeling of this adventure, this is one of the worst translations from book to film I have ever witnessed, whereas the Lord of the Rings trilogy was a very good translation from book, the Hobbit has so far been the opposite, and The Hobbit had the potential to be one of the best fantasy adventures to ever be put onto the big screen.\u000a\u000aA complete failure and has been destroyed by some big wigs who used it as a money cow. I can only assume that anybody who rated this film highly is not actually familiar with the story of the Hobbit.\u000a\u000aSome of the dwarfs didn't even look like dwarfs??!...How on earth did they think they were going to get away with that? and what all this about an underlying love story between an Elf and a Dwarf??\u000a\u000aThe biggest load of tripe I have ever had the misfortune of watching, its painful.

VI honestly can't believe how well received this film has been! I am a huge fan of Tolkien and his books including The Hobbit. I was quite shocked when I heard they were making this into 3 movies when the whole book is not even as long as the first LOTR book. \u000a\u000aHowever I accepted it and went to see the first film which was better than I thought it would be but still not that accurate to the book. The Desolation Of Smaug however is a disaster. I came out of the cinema in shock at how they have destroyed such a beautiful story. I wonder if they have even read the book as this was just so different.\u000a\u000aSure they added certain things in from the book but overall it was a completely new take on the book. It is like they said to hell with the brilliant story lets just make this into an over the top special effects extravaganza. \u000a\u000aI was very excited for this film, as a huge fan of LOTR and The Hobbit but now I kind of feel very angry and upset that this was allowed to be made. The only people who will like this Film are people who have not had a chance to read the book. Fans of Tolkien will be upset I am sure. The barrel escape was embarrassing and well so was the whole film.\u000a\u000aI can't believe I am saying this but I am certainly not looking forward to the third and final part. I already know it won't be accurate to the book and it will just be another 'Lets see how huge we can make this look'

VOne of the central themes of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is the manner in which different personalities are affected by the corrupting effects of wealth and power. Some, like Bilbo, are completely able to retain their integrity. At the end of Tolkien's novel he accepts only a small parcel of treasure for his part in the quest, such as one pony can carry. When he finds the Arkenstone he does not claim it for himself but bestows it in a manner that he deems morally fit. Thorin Oakenshield has a fatal attraction to the dragon's hoard of gold, but on his deathbed is able to retrace and find himself again. Smaug the dragon is hugely greedy, use his great powers aggressively, and is undone by his vanity (believing himself invulnerable).\u000a\u000aIt's quite clear, and ironic, that the makers of this trilogy were similarly blinded by the lure of gold.\u000a\u000aTolkien's novel is a literary classic, written in beautiful prose, and illustrated by himself. His special gift was to depict a magical world where characters are nevertheless wholly believable and realistic, and their actions faultlessly motivated. My question to the filmmakers is: why change anything? Why was it necessary to change the story in so many, many, many ways? And whence the presumption that they are entitled to do this? Overweening arrogance ... And embarrassing, actually.\u000a\u000aThe makers evidently felt they needed to pad out the original, but in the process they have lost so much. I'm still waiting for a definitive version. I imagine something animated, and faithful to Tolkien's original illustrations.

VIn my review of the first Hobbit movie I complained that PJ was taking liberties with the story line and brushing over important details for the sake of action. Well, in part 2 he dispenses with such inconveniences as plot and credulity and instead plumps for almost 3 hours of ridiculous fight scenes, twisting the original story into such unwieldy and impossible shapes that you will very likely spend the entire film going 'What? That's not what happened! She doesn't even exist!'\u000a\u000aI won't make a list or anything, but the dwarfs didn't split up, there wasn't an army of orcs chasing them, Laketown was nothing like that, Beorn didn't do that and so on etc etc. This is less The Hobbit and more PJ making it up as he goes along.\u000a\u000aI know that Hollywood needs a love story to feed the need for the get the girl kill the baddies plot line that's been the staple of film making for almost a century, but to entirely invent 2 characters (Legolas is not mentioned in The Hobbit) simply to make it happen reeks of desperation. We shan't mention the vomit inducing Dwarf/Elf touchy feely segment.\u000a\u000aThe film fails on all but the most basic of levels; it is an action film, very loosely based on a JRR Tolkien novel. What it certainly is not is The Hobbit, a tale of adventure and personal courage. had this been made before LOTR then it would have rightly been laughed out of the cinema, but audiences are so hungry for more of the same that Jackson has been allowed to do whatever he likes, even, once again, adding a knob gag to a children's story.\u000a\u000aFor his next project I fully expect him to remake the story of Jesus, only this time he'll be a prize fighter who has to beat Pilate to win the life of Mary Magdelene, who has been taken prisoner by the evil drug lord Satan.\u000a\u000aUtterly appalling.

The initial decision to make 3 movies out of a small novel doomed any hope there was of making this work. As usual, the smell of money was too alluring to weak minds like Jackson's, and so we have this dross. It's a shame.

VI went into The Desolation of Smaug with low expectations and managed to be disappointed. Like many, I love The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but the prequel trilogy has yet to impress.\u000a\u000aThat's not entirely true. Peter Jackson's cameo made me laugh out loud. I also loved the visuals. My only complaint with An Unexpected Journey's visuals was that the orcs looked totally different than they did in the LotR movies. Thankfully, the orcs (with the exception of that pale fellow and his chum) are back to their old menacing look and feel.\u000a\u000aBut TDoS does not impress in writing, acting, music, action sequences, or anything else.\u000a\u000aWriting: If I had taken a drink every time there was a dramatic pause followed by some God-awful, stupid line, I might have given this review a higher score on account of being too inebriated to catch all the awful writing and nonsensical plot filler that littered the last half of the movie.\u000a\u000aActing: With how long this movie is, and with how much filler they squeezed in, it's amazing to me that it never seemed like anyone had time to properly deliver a line of dialogue. Everything felt rushed. Questions bled into answers as if the characters knew what would be said before it was said. The emotions of the characters seemed either non- existent or so over the top that the viewer could not possibly relate.\u000a\u000aMusic: I didn't notice it until the very end when I thought, "There's music playing, isn't there?" Any LotR fan knows this is a bad thing.\u000a\u000aAction Sequences: These were my least favorite parts of the movie, and they took up about half of the time. I love a good action sequence when it's done right. However, these are not. Half of the action was silly and cheesy, and the other half was boring (not quite half, actually, because I properly liked one bit of action: when that dwarf did a barrel roll, if you know what I mean). It was always predictable. "Predictable? That's the nature of a prequel!" I hear you scream. Well then tell the writers to get the action over with fast so we can focus on, say, caring about the characters.\u000a\u000aAnything Else: Smaug was stupid; he looked cliché-dragon, sounded cliché-deep-voice, and acted like an enemy in a bad action movie (coincidence???). The movie strayed far from the book. I mean, I'm not the sort to bad-mouth a movie because it's different from the book, but I am one to bad-mouth a movie that ruins everything it touches in the book. Which in this case is everything.

VI couldn't force myself to watch this film for more than 30 minutes. I had watched An Unexpected Journey, so naturally my expectations were extremely low, but at least I was hoping I could bare to watch it until the end. Nope. It was enough for me to see the scene with Beorn, to realize how bad this movie is going to be. Beorn is a bloody joke. I mean no offense to the actor, but his performance seemed extremely unconvincing to me, and the visual style that they chose for him is so... different from the book, I just couldn't get into it. The point where I stopped watching was in the halls of the elven king, where the king and Thorin have a conversation. The king's face suddenly turns into an ugly, disfigured shape and then turns back to normal again, apparently to stress the idea he was expressing at that moment. My question is - why? Why would you do that? It just feels out of place, like one of those one-too-many cgi things that are there only for the purpose of being CGI and looking "cool". The performance of the actor, who played the king, was also lackluster, in my opinion. I don't get why elves can't act like elves - immortal beings, that are wise and ancient. In this movie they act more like teenagers who have just reached puberty. There's even some romantic implications between a female elf and a dwarf... I mean, I have no words for that. This movie blew me away with how little it has in common with the book or the Tolkien's universe in general. It's an abomination of the work towards which the author had devotes most of his life and it's sad to see that it's so popular and will forever be engraved in the minds of the masses as The Hobbit - a film based on professor Tolkien's book.

VWell the first three films were pretty good and in-fact you can look at a whole range of films like The Godfather, Star Wars that started out well and understand why they stopped or in the case of Star Wars just got worse and worse.\u000a\u000aThis film has all the characteristics of something that has passed its "best before" day. It has so much filler, a few set-up CGI action sequences that keep it on track (and by that I mean not dozing off to sleep)and acting that plainly is not demanding at all.\u000a\u000aIf you have never seen the first three films you would be wondering what all the fuss was about. Quite clearly this has now become a money making franchise which is trying to get every last bit of dollar out of as little material as possible.\u000a\u000aAt least Harry Potter knew when to stop, but I do hope we are not going to have more of the same otherwise everyone who was involved on this will look back and see they stopped caring about craft and endeavour.

VWhen we finally get to meet the magnificent dragon Smaug, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, at the climax of Peter Jackson's second instalment of his The Hobbit trilogy, we find him curled up beneath an enormous stash of gold coins and jewels, blissfully in the land of nod. After sitting through over two hours of this slog of a film, it's precisely where I wished I was. The Desolation of Smaug is yet further evidence that 9 hours worth of movies is not needed for Tolkien's delightful - and slim - novel. It feels like - to quote Ian Holm's Bilbo Baggins from The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) - thin, like butter scraped over too much bread.\u000a\u000aThe story picks up as the dwarfs evade capture from the orc general Azog (Manu Bennett) and seek refuge in the home of Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), a skin-changer who often takes the form of a giant bear. Setting of again towards Erebor to reclaim the dwarfs homeland, Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Thorin (Richard Armitage), Gandalf (Ian McKellen) et al reach the Elven forest of Mirkwood. Gandalf departs to further investigate the strange goings-on at Dol Gondur, where the mysterious necromancer (Benedict Cumberbatch) seems to be building an army of sorts. In Mirkwood, the dwarfs meet the Elvenking Thranduil (Lee Pace) and his son Legolas (Orlando Bloom), who imprison the dwarfs following an altercation.\u000a\u000aThe Desolation of Smaug is simply a collection of things that happen - not much has a relevant impact on the story, nor does it develop any of the characters or make much of the film particularly interesting to watch. It's a near-3 hour film that barely has any time for its characters, preferring instead to repeatedly throw them into situations that apparently call for an extended, CGI-laden action sequence. It felt very much like a Middle Earth Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) - vacant and almost soulless. The Lord of the Rings trilogy used CGI when it had to, and chose instead to welcome the natural beauty of the New Zealand landscape. And thanks to some gorgeous set design for the interiors, it felt like you could reach out and touch Middle Earth. Here, everything feels digital.\u000a\u000aThere's also too much padding. When the dwarfs arrive in Lake Town, smuggled in by the revolutionary-type Bard (Luke Evans), it develops a strange love-triangle between dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner), elf-warrior Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas. This can be argued as character development for one of the much underdeveloped dwarfs, but its portrayed so blandly that it's nothing more of a distraction to Bilbo and Thorin finally encountering Smaug. Bard himself is also relatively one-dimensional, not much more than a rugged face that has been spawned by destiny - a reluctant hero that has chosen a different path to the one that seems lined up for him. Sound familiar?\u000a\u000aIt's not all bad of course, so although Peter Jackson has been caught up in the special-effects machine, he still shows his talent for the spectacle with one action scene that sees the dwarfs escape Mirkwood and a micro army of rampant orcs in barrels down a river. It is a silly, overblown set-piece, but it proves funny and thrilling, a genuinely exciting highlight within one of the film's most drawn-out chapters. Also, Smaug himself doesn't disappoint. Although he's entirely CGI, the giant beast is entirely real and, thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch, uncomfortably menacing. His exchanges with Bilbo are the movie's best moments, as they both try and outsmart each other with words and tricks. Which makes it all the more disappointing when the film movies into yet another overwrought action scene.\u000a\u000aI'm sure the obvious lack of heart and storytelling quality won't worry the producers (the film is already the 49th highest-grossing film of all time), nor will it Peter Jackson. This adaptation is now so far removed from the book's original vision that I don't think the sounds of Tolkien shouting "Fool of a Took!" in his grave will be giving Jackson sleepless nights. I remember in 2003, when The Return of the King (2003) was reaching its first climax at three hours, my bum was glued to the seat and my palms were sweaty, hit with the tragic realisation that this film trilogy would soon be over and all I had to look forward to was the Extended Edition DVD. At the 2 hour mark of The Desolation of Smaug, my bum was numb, I was shifting in my seat, and I was wondering what food I had in the fridge for later. Says it all really.\u000a\u000awww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

VThe first three Lord of the Rings movies were excellent. Gorgeous scenery, solid acting, wonderful soundtrack, and a decent script true to the books. The trilogy really brought Tolkien's world to life.\u000a\u000aThen we had The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in 2012. It introduced some new elements Tolkien never thought of and elaborated on some things he merely alluded to. This was a mistake, and many parts of the movie suffered from these artistic liberties brought it. There was potential though, so I hoped the next film would do more. Unfortunately, it didn't do anything good.\u000a\u000aDesolation of Smaug continues what An Unexpected Journey began, sinking a fantastic series of movies even deeper into pathetic mire of misery that will make most Tolkien fans wince. This film is just terrible and 80% or more of it can be skipped over with no real loss. \u000a\u000aSuspension of disbelief is out the window. Some scenes are BREATHTAKINGLY awful. I can't even begin to describe how utterly ridiculous and campy they are. Particularly the barrel-riding sequence. Desolation of Smaug devolves into something so unbearable, calling it "typical Hollywood" would be a compliment. It's trite. Banal. Hackneyed. Clichéd. Vapid.\u000a\u000aI would rather watch The Room (2003) or Rubber (2010) every day for the rest of my life than sit through the entirety of this film again. I only give it a 4/10 because some of the scenery is decent, the actors did alright, and there's Lee Pace + Benedict Cumberbatch. \u000a\u000aScript: 1/10. Acting: 8/10 if you consider how they acted instead of what they acted. Special effects: 6/10. Music: good, but not used appropriately in most spots, so 6/10. Amount of clichés: unbearably high.

VI absolutely LOVED this movie. The Hobbit is and always has been my favorite book, and I am a total nerd over the 1977 animated version. So, I have been on my toes waiting for Desolation to come out. Needless to say, I was not at all disappointed. Jackson made brilliant decisions about what to add to, and what to skim over in the film. The scene where Gandalf confronts the Necromancer, and his true identity is revealed through a succession of a never ending eyes within the great eye made my hair stand on end. Benedict Cumberbatch was a perfect choice as Smaug. His booming, growling voice really impressed Smaug's ego to the audience. And, Weta absolutely blew me away with their design for Smaug. He was enormous and frightening, yet beautifully so at the same time. I saw the movie on Imax 3D, and it was beyond impressive. My husband and I left grinning from ear to ear, and wishing the next installment of the trilogy was already available. As a fan, I honestly could not wish for more. It was funny, scary, romantic, adventurous, and packed with thrilling and fun action scenes. It was well worth the 18 dollar ticket costs, and I will happily line up and pay the same for the next film.

VIts based on the Hobbing but the film is good Peter Jackson finally proved he can make all movie for any child , romantic , and really politically correct so once again two cheers to the director Peter Jackson. Go watch this with all family and kids because this film is for them is for they'r kinda age and its basically not bad.\u000a\u000aThe last film from Peter Jackson, "The Lovely Bones," had sent shivers down my spine and made me think that this company had finally run itself into the ground – result was that it was a massive flop. But with this one, I have managed to regain some faith in the films that Jackson is now releasing. It is a great family movie, good for the holiday season, and some people might even need a hankie. But take it for what it is, a fun movie, enjoyable with the nerd-set.\u000a\u000aPeter Jackson, the director follows his own passion of influences despite strong objections from the actual Tolkien estate. What The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey could have done without, are certain inappropriate extra characters not found in the original tale, bringing to mind instead George Lucas's Phantom Menace. Also the film overstays its welcome when it drudges on for a good 15 minutes after the dwarfs have resolved their issues with Bilbo. The romantic track between certain humans with newly added female members of their species seems obligatory at best, and it doesn't help that Gandalf and Baggins have zero chemistry together. I think this was deliberately done by Jackson's camp.\u000a\u000aThe weakest section of the movie is its music by Howard Shore. It's one of the most unimpressive work from the maestro with not even a single melodious song. This project needed some special children songs which were found missing. Special Effects are uncomplicated and are not used in excess, which is intelligent thinking by the director. Why 27 animals were killed offhand by the film crew yet goes unexplained, but nevermind that when there is Hobbit fun to had, right? All one can say is that its an OK movie, with a simple look and has nothing special to talk about. Something extraordinary was expected from Peter Jackson but sadly it was not there.

VPeter Jackson really outdid himself, he managed to create Hollywood-  action-garbage out of a great book. \u000aJ.R.R. Tolkien would be furious and sad to see his works raped in this  kind of manner.  \u000aI am also sad to see such a great work of literature being turned into  something so deformed. And for what? Some changes are understandable  and I can understand how plot lines might need some work for the big  screen but this..! The story is completely rewritten, it is really weak  and relies only to the numerous actions scenes and great visuals. \u000aThis is not The Hobbit, this is just Peter Jackson raping a great book.

VDid I read the right book? After seeing this last night I'm not quite sure Peter Jackson did. I get it. One small book, into three films, you have to elaborate. I was a stout defender of the three film decision and I stand corrected by all those who called it folly. PJ & CO. have not given us what they did a decade ago with Tolkiens The Lord Of The Rings. His reach exceeded his grasp. Let me be honest, the film itself is wonderful. Its fantastic and powerful and dynamic and bursting with action. Yet....somehow it is not anything at all like The Hobbit.\u000a\u000aTake the beginning, after the prologue, Beorn looks ridiculous. He looks more like a centaur from the Harry Potter movies than he does like his description in the book. Meager time is given to him and his scene is droll and dreary. They could have started the movie off fun and lighthearted again like in AUJ with a great feast scene with Beorn's trained animal companions! Then we hasten (and by hasten I mean FLY YOU FOOLS) into Mirkwood, which is again HASTENED. No Elvish lights and dinners, no desperate and famished company, no magic river...\u000a\u000aThen, we come upon the spiders. This, in the book, is a gigantic moment for Bilbo. His courage and bravery to (in the book) insult, distract and "sting" the spiders to save the Dwarfs is another of his turning points in the book. The scene you read is breathtaking and on the edge of your seat intense. What you see is similar...but the arrival of Legolas (somehow looking 20 years older) and his girlfriend Tauriel send the entire vision of Tolkien into disarray.\u000a\u000aI will allow you, if you have not seen this, to explore the mind of Jackson yourself. I will say again that this is a great movie. If Jackson had called this movie "The Dwarfs and The Hobbit" or "How The East Was Won", changed some names and removed all copyright infringements this movie would be one of the best ever made. BUT! You have to take source material into account. If this was an essay on The Hobbit I would have given Peter Jackson an F. A 4 will just have to do though.

VAside from the mega- hype that the Hobbit has triggered, you should be aware that The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is little profound and, at best, a children's movie in the shape of a fantasy-adventure. The very nice atmosphere and scenery of the film takes the viewer into a rather artificial Middle-earth and despite many references to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, it doesn't portray this world as it was imagined by Tolkien, or how the previous trilogy portrayed it. Mostly created using CGI and green screen it simply doesn't appear real and you feel like a stranger in Middle-earth . Real Tolkien fans who love to read the books avoid this film because it makes a fool of one the greatest masterpieces in the history of film and literature.

VPeter Jackson, now referred to as "Sir Peter Jackson" initially didn't want to do the Hobbit story idea, but later proposed "the Hobbit" as a three picture story arc. Incidentally, at the first film opening he stated that he hadn't actually seen a finished edit of the picture and as people found out in following months, the movie was a massive disappointment compared to the New Line franchise he directed a decade earlier.\u000a\u000aThis sequel is intended to a be a return to form, but its still a disappointing movie, largely for two reasons; firstly because Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and the other main players here just don't seem to know who, or what the main character is about very much, and because they don't the audience doesn't feel terribly involved either. Bilbo Baggins, the central character, never feels pivotal to the story, doesn't feel either like a leader or a hero or even much like a pitiable victim in the movies numerous set pieces.\u000a\u000aThe second reason is because the film is fundamentally flawed in the way its produced and distributed. Audiences wearing grey 3D glasses lose color value, and an attempt to restore the proper luminance in 3D theaters led the film company to release the movie at twice the standard frame rate; as a result, makeup, costume detail, and background elements look obviously fake, instead of the magical, poetic sequences that made the original films such great entertainment.\u000a\u000aThe script feels like well-combed fan fiction, which suggests that, really, "the Hobbit" should have been one powerful, lyrical sort of movie that recreates the vibe from the original Lord of the Rings environment, and remains faithful to the source material. It feels a bit pointless explaining this but the idea of a dragon guarding gold under a mountain has been a staple of European folklore mythology long before Tolkien created 'the Hobbit'. \u000a\u000aIf you get to the end of this movie, as suggested in the trailers, the dragon is a massive and spectacular beast, but doesn't save this picture from the feeling that its illogical, over-padded and overproduced.

VI liked Lord of the Rings. The first two adaptations of The Hobbit are truly dreadful, however. The worst was Smaug, who instead of being a gigantic overawing threat became a cartoon character humbled by snowballs and unable to even injure one little dwarf in half a dozen approaches. That would have been enough to ruin the movie for me, but there was more, some of which other reviewers covered. It seems we must be subject to gymnastic special effects from creatures clearly incapable of them, video game death, and unimaginably odious "love" scenes in every movie or Jackson's world is not complete. I hope his day passes, soon, and with it this sort of film making.

VNot everyone was one hundred percent happy with the film adaptation of The Lord of The Rings. But I feel certain when I say that every Tolkien fan did not believe it could get as bad as this. I loved the books and liked the films but this is a travesty.\u000a\u000aEven if this was just some random movie about a dragon it would still be a huge mess of a movie. We have a supposedly intelligent and powerful dragon that laid waste to both a human city and a dwarven kingdom. But suddenly he goes all Scooby doo villain on us and can't even maim a single dwarf. Rather he spends 20 minutes stupidly smashing into stuff like a fat dog on a slippery floor.\u000a\u000aAnother thing that plagues this filth is that it can't decide if it is trying to be a kids movie with stupid fat dwarfs bouncing around like basketballs or if it's trying to be a edgy movie about angsty elves decapitating and stabbing orcs in the god damn neck. \u000a\u000aThen the movie ends with a soft pop music song with slight influence from the movie.\u000a\u000aThis mixes like oil and water. Do not waste your time.

VI'd like to know when Peter Jackson changed his name to Tolkien because that is the only reason I can think of for him totally changing a charming children's book into a typically bloated Hollywood moan-fest. The story is completely mangled, full of characters and situations which were never in the book, some of which were lifted from Lord Of The Rings. It opens with Bilbo and co. trying to out run the defiler (hate that name) and narrowly missing being eaten by Beorn. The dwarfs were NEVER threatened by the skin changer and while he could be dangerous, in the book he also had a great sense of humour and laughed when the dwarfs were introduced to him in twos. He was so miserable he reminded me of the centaurs in Narnia. Then we have Mirkwood. Upon being attacked by spiders, Bilbo has his inevitable Gollum moment when he loses the ring and takes it back from a spider. (Never happened). Then, instead of Bilbo rescuing the dwarfs, they are rescued by elves with Legolas doing his skateboard act once again. The fight scene between the elves and the spiders was the most laughable I have seen in years. We then go to Thranduil who behaves without honour toward an Orc which is against the highest principle of Elf-kind, and of course we mustn't forget the ridiculous love triangle between Legolas,(why?) Turiel, (who?)and Kili. Do me a favour. Elves and dwarfs would never mix, even an admittedly delightful elf-maiden as this one. I could go on.....the laughable and inaccurate flight in the barrels, the ridiculous sight of Legolas doing his crouching Tiger act, Kili getting wounded, the dwarfs stealing weapons, Bard threatening to kill them and the dumb scenes with the Master of Laketown. I didn't think Stephen fry was capable of such bad overacting. All of the dwarfs went to the mountain, not just six. The dwarfs never got challenged by Smaug and they certainly never tried to kill him. All in all this movie is such a fiasco I am embarrassed to have been seen coming out of the cinema. The only saving grace of this shambles was a good atmospheric scene in Dol Guldur with Gandalf and a surprisingly touching scene when Turiel was attempting to save Kili's life. Summing up, if you want to see a fairly action packed no-brain film then this is the movie for you. However, if you want a faithful adaptation of a beloved book, avoid this rubbish like the plague.

VPeter Jackson did let us down. The fact that there are a lot related writings to the Hobbit can in no way be used as a reason to justify 3 movies since the changes are for the most part completely different from the other original writings. Look .. I get that a movie director should have some leeway in changing the story .. I even like the elvish warrior lady Tauriel … but so many of the changes are simply stupid … Gandalf goes off to this mountain to meet Radagast?! Because? Did they really need to go there to decide to go to Dol Guldur? And what exactly does Gandalf hope to accomplish? In the book there was an actual battle, an attack by the forces of the White Council. Why not do just that?! It would be far cooler than Gandalf getting stuck hanging in a bird cage.\u000a\u000aPeter Jackson has transformed the story of the Hobbit so much that it scarcely resembles the original. It is not that none of the changes do not work, many in fact do, but for every 1 that does, there are 3 others which are simply laughably stupid. And it is these stupid ones, and there are scores of these, that basically ruined the movie for me. \u000a\u000aSo Smaug is fighting 10 dwarfs and 1 hobbit, all unarmed, and cannot kill a single one? So he goes to Lake Town rather than simply continue the fight with these unarmed foes? Why in the world would Smaug leave the dwarfs and Bilbo in possession of the Erebor and its staggering treasure so he could make an attack on Esgaroth, a place he could attack and obliterate any time after he kills and eats the dwarfs and one hobbit? There are so many of these staggering dumb plot devices like this that it is just shameful that Tolkien's name has to be associated with this pile of golden dung. We can only hope that someday some director with a bit more class and common sense and artistic integrity, will give a far better interpretation of a classic fantasy story rather than mangling one into something absolutely pathetic. And I won't even go into the Hanna Barbara cartoon physics that seem to operate every time the dwarfs encounter foes, destroying any last vestige of dignity or parallel real world Tolkien intentionally created over 6 decades of his life. \u000a\u000aAnd there has to be three movies to tell this story because .... ? Three movies and so many characters never are even fully developed like over half the dwarfs and Beorn.\u000a\u000aThe truth is this trilogy is more about more money than anything else, and never about getting it right or otherwise Bilbo would actually be major hero in the movie rather than an afterthought. It is basically a glorified, cheap cell phone video game.\u000a\u000aPeter Jackson does not understand nor care about Tolkien's work no matter how much he professes otherwise. I only wish the real JRR Tolkien were here to shred him personally into "quivering ribbons" verbally with his razor sharp wit. See The Letters of JRR Tolkien for a sample review of Tolkien's for a proposed movie script during his lifetime.

VWow. If you read the book and then watch this you have a masterclass on how to take something full of magic and wonder and turn it into an overly lengthy, tedious and poorly adapted movie. A very average film which follows the same wildly unimaginative Peter Jackson orchestration. Some truly shocking performances (specifically Evangeline Lilly and Orlando Bloom) but to be fair they are not helped by some dire scripting. \u000a\u000aPadded out with unimaginative "chase me chase me" scenes this film comes across as many disparate narratives that do not bind together. Even if you don't pay to watch this film you will feel robbed when you leave.

VI don't know where to start....this movie remains me a Disneyland amusement park, but hey - the first Pirates movie was made on the basis of Disney attraction and was far much better than this...and Smaug has behind it's shoulders a cult book...What went wrong? Well, PJ's ego went wrong...the decision of squeezing 3 movies out of one tiny book was wrong...to change all those great rubber-faced LOTR orcs for a bad CGI was wrong...No story, just running - being captured - running - being captured - running...action sequences interminable, after the 10th decapited head I stopped counting...Action far away from credibility, no physical laws in this movie, Legolas looked fat aand older than in LOTR 70 years later, Tauriel...another super-elf - the elven guards were stupid and blind, orcs just came quietly as ninjas and killed them all, they don't mind walking under the sun (that was a big problem for them in LOTR) - they even look differently than in LOTR, everything digital, including the horse Legolas ride in the Lake City (does anyone know where the horse came from?), Beorn - or was it the Wolverine? Not sure, but the coolest stuff from the book isn't in this movie. Why? Because PJ thinks he can tell better stories than one J.R.R.Tolkien...this movie has almost nothing from the book, the few things are so changes that making this movie with different names of characters would save money for the license...the love story between Tauriel and Filli...I felt embarrassing for the actors for being forced to play this...really sad...Smaug - it has to be as a Jumbo Jet..The gold treasure? Of course - big like a 7 floor building...and go now Bilbo and find the Arkenstone :-) and what was that at the end? 20 minutes of running here and there and the stupid dragon didn't hit anyone in front of his nose? And the dragon fire has no burn power whatsoever...and the stuff with melting gold, doing a sand cake 7 floors tall golden dwarf and melt it in a second to kill the dragon...and then PJ probably thought Hey...there's another movie to make....let's make the dragon fly away..this movie has no inner coherence, it was a mayor dissapontment...Hobbit 1 was much better...I don't understand why so many people gives Smaug so high rating....this has nothing to do with Tolkien, the Middleearth of LOTR, this movie has no spirit.

VWhat to say about this godawful mess of a film?!!! I'm simply agog (or is that Azog?).\u000a\u000aWhen he directed LOTR, Jackson trimmed down an abundance of material to create a gorgeous film experience. His LOTR was by no means exactly the book, but it worked as a cinematic experience of Tolkien's masterpiece. Beautiful, moving, funny, thrilling, profound and elegiac.\u000a\u000aWith this film, he's done the EXACT opposite. He's taken an enchanting, funny, thrilling story and inexplicably either cut all the fun moments out of it or overloaded them until they become dull and obvious. When not doing that he's busy glopping it up and weighing it down with elements from LOTR or the appendices or just crap pulled out of thin air as far as I can tell. It's hard to fathom that it was directed by the same person. Sloppy storytelling, dull, repetitive, messy to look at for the most part and, unbelievably, boring. Most disappointing, is that the film is practically un-Tolkien. I wasn't a big fan of the first film, but aside from the huge misstep of putting Orcs into it, I liked it for the most part. Desolation of Smaug, however, is irredeemable.\u000a\u000aI guess one of the most fantastic coming-of-"middle-age" stories in English literature wasn't enough for Jackson and his crew. They didn't care to make The Hobbit. They preferred instead to make a movie that should be titled: "A Goddamned Bunch of Stoopid Orcs Swarming Around and Getting Killed for 3 Hours and Other Crap That Has Absolutely Nothing to do with Bilbo Baggins and His Journey There and Back Again."

VAs a LOTR fan,familiar with The Hobbit in literary form since I was a child, When I first saw Fellowship Of The Ring as a teen I was so excited thinking,I really hope someone makes this as a full movie prequel one day..So imagine if you will, my excitement when it was revealed they would in fact be making The Hobbit series. Ater the first, slight let down but still quite true to form.. I clicked on the trailer for this one with huge anticipation- and sadly, this is where it all fell flat.\u000a\u000aI just want to point out before going further, that I am the first to defend book to movie format from critics who carp on that there are too many differences blah blah and call for artistic license if something is stated to be "based on" the book and have always made exceptions for this one as well. However,if this film had veered off from day one,it would be less disappointing and I would accept this rule more. That said, the trilogy is very true to Tolkein's form for the best part and that feeling of relief that Jackson and Co had not gone uber-Hollywood back then has sadly died in a pile of ash suited to Smaug himself. Jackson, who gets all mad at people for for using a the Hobbit name/references in an unrelated manner seems to have almost done the very same ironically - he uses the name "The Hobbit" and some characters/places,yet this seems to be where the similarity ends. \u000a\u000aSo, back to this trailer then, well my first thoughts were: 1.why,is Ed Sheeran singing the music? I love the guy's music but really? is this a Disney movie now? what happened to the beauty and seriousness of Enya and the likes? The style kind of fits the film but it's too pop like. 2.Do we really need a female elf? (unknown male in the book..) Her existence is all too transparent:eye-candy for the boys,some fluffy girl power with pointy ears and a pretty face for the girls. As if that's not bad enough, there is this sickly and horrifically Twilight-esque love triangle between her, Legolas (who also technically does not exist currently..)and a (albeit the only looker) Dwarf? 3. The pronunciation of "Smaug"(the terrible-come-stock dragon style villain for this movie's name sake) got me stumped as they insist it's "smowg" but even hal the film crew call him "smorg"(I always believed it to be pronounced as Smorg (soft augh sound)-though I could well be wrong) 4.Even in the trailers, the spark seems duller and the dialogue more user friendly- by which I mean a kid could have written the script it seems.So this from the off had me concerned to say the least.\u000a\u000aSo why?- I believe the answer would be, the female teen and young adult male fan-base. sod the main audience who have followed the franchise for decades, they no longer count it seems, it's all about grabbing the kids for a GTA style graphically violent, poorly scripted, rushed FX overkill of a movie.It's nice they have included the youngsters more and all, but why at the risk of the context? This film franchise has still attracted kids in it's true form ( I was a teen first viewing it with many others around us in the cinema) so why alter it's style so much now? I guess due to the way things are generally marketed these days. \u000a\u000aMr Jackson, a 200 million dollar budget- what prey tell, convinced you that you had to CGI a HORSE? Not to mention everything else around? Rushing over parts of the book that are more than relevant and would have been enough to fill the full movie had it been a reasonable hour and a half long say.I am not happy about this but of course, the reason is clear once again- it's to get to the Jackson style "romance" and action sequences that are somewhat bordering on loosing all credibility now. And, just how much of an ego maniac ARE you to have to play a cameo at the start? personally I'd be ashamed to even lend my name to this travesty- let alone my physical presence for all to see. I am so saddened that this beautiful trilogy has finally succumbed to the Hollywood style so near to reaching it's closure. As someone who could not wait to see this film originally, I feel I'd have been better spending my time sticking pins in my eyes for almost 3 hours.\u000a\u000aSo to sum up, some good parts- yes there were but they were so brief I could barely remember them. Some effects were true to the original but mostly not. It was nice to see the cast but even Gandalf- and I NEVER believed I'd say this- seemed to bumble his way through the storyline like he was on drugs or drunk though I very much doubt this to be due to Sir Ian. And Smaug-He is internally full of fire, how would molten gold HE melted,kill him??No,unsurprisingly it won't- but, Dwarfs are so smart, yes? Terrible ending, of course classic "let's pay to watch the next one cliffhanger" "what have we done" is painfully ironic and would have been the best time for Jackson's cameo-as himself" Cue black screen and Ed Sheeran warbling " "I see Fire." Well,I was seeing red, but it wasn't fire.So, to you Mr Jackson I will say this (not that you will ever see it but it still feels nice to vent and all..)You could not have done this book more injustice if you had opened the spine in the middle, crapped all over it, ripped some pages off to wipe your backside then set the remains on fire. The End. ( And no,I won't be seeing the third unless he wakes from his literary coma and does much better to bring this round..)

VI am not a writer. Neither i have reviewed any movie in my life but i am a huge fan of Tolkien and his genius. A man who took a decade to create a world so magnificent and magical that words can't even explain it. Then a person went on a rampage and destroyed his life's work in just two movies. The Hobbit series. As my Sensei said, "no one can capture the middle-earth in motion pictures but it is the destruction of the work to just earn cash that i hate". Desolation of Smaug is a disrespect to the intelligence and hard work of Tolkien over the years. The liberties taken in the movie totally contradicts with the theme of the novel and they are not good in any sense. One of the most iconic battle of the Mirkwood has been reduced to little to nothing while focusing on the very unimportant things that came out of the mind of Peter Jackson. He tried to cash in the movie by making it a SMAUG-FEST. If you like Tolkien's work and even have a single bit of respect for Mr. Tolkien, i hope you will not support Peter Jackson as the other sheep. With this, i will stop my complaining. I have rated it 1/10 but i want to say sorry to Mr. Tolkien for rating this movie. Only if negative rating exists.

VThe first half of the movie has no plot. There are no character developments, apart from the attempted drama in Mirkwood where Bilbo first uses the ring other than to escape. And the elves have no personality. Actually, I'm sure they do, but it's not portrayed as well as in LotR or the first movie.\u000a\u000aThe Hobbit is two films, not three. I could have seen the first film ending on the way to Lake Town. And the second (and final) film starting in Lake Town. The whole Mirkwood thing doesn't say much at all for the story apart from creating more (irrelevant) tension between the elves and the dwarfs. Thranduil should have been a greater part of the story on a personality level, instead we get more Legolas stunts. And the Beorn thing is a waste of time. PJ should have taken his own advice from the Tom Bombadil "issue" in LotR, and just cut him out. He has nothing useful to say either way apart from that he hates orcs more than dwarfs. Yay for that or something...\u000a\u000aThe introduction of Legolas is actually extremely cheesy; it takes the Legolas moments at the battle of helms deep and the mumakils and shits all over it. It's like a preteen girl trying out makeup for the first time, and not knowing when to stop, when it's borderline absurd. Not to mention that this time it's TWO elves being circus artists at the same time. Yes, elves are agile, fast and efficient, but they are NOT there to be a tribute to the comedy of Jackie Chan or the artistry of cirque de soleil. Even the fight in Lake Town is pitiful. And how is it that Legolas almost dies to an orc standing right behind him (and twice is being saved by one of the dwarfs and Tauriel respectively) but somehow anticipates every move from 3 other orcs at the same time?\u000a\u000aEnough about the elves. Dwarfs next. There are what, 13 of them? At most two develop through the film. Kili plays a major role with the Tauriel love story thing, but his dialog is very - in lack of a more suitable word - amateurish. It could have been Aragorn/Arwen all over again. Instead it's more like Clerks II. And it's the only part of the story in this film that would have lifted the movie to its own feet. Instead it's more like a footnote.\u000a\u000aThe other dwarf that changes through the film is Thorin. As in he becomes more like his grandfather. Perhaps he does realize at the end that this is not the way to go, but that's pretty much it. No deeper thoughts, no contemplation or any influence from other characters. Just a sudden change of behaviour.\u000a\u000aAnd another thing this film is very poorly equipped with: Acting. Especially in Lake Town. It was bad. The first film was fantastic with all the dwarfs, the goblins, and even Martin Freeman being very into Bilbo. It doesn't even show in part 2. He's never the focus of the story (movie-wise), nor is any other character apart from Smaug, who - let's face it - is a villain whose feelings we could not give a flipping toss about. What would have been more important to show even more (or at all, really) is Thorin's struggle to not be his grandfather. Make it stand out from the rest of the story, which at the end of it felt like nothing more than filler between parts 1 and 3.\u000a\u000aWhat else is there to say... oh yeah... The intro sequence is never followed up throughout the film. As in, it says nothing useful, and all it does is give PJ his annual cameo. It doesn't even reach the LotR intros to the ankles in terms of relevance.\u000a\u000aStephen Fry as the Lake Town master (not a bad casting decision, but I suspect mainly for the PR) is reminiscent of the Goblin King, but he is not projected as that powerful and consequently the tension of being in Lake Town is very weak, even after Bard switches to become the "enemy". He still helps them, perhaps with a desire to avenge his forefather's reputation. But the movie is so shallow it never explores these things. It just says what happened before and the acting fails to portray the characters' deeper intentions, if there even are any.\u000a\u000aNOW WHAT IS GOOD WITH THIS MOVIE?\u000a\u000aWell, quite a few things, but things that should be secondary to what is already mentioned, in order to make it worth sitting through two and a half hours.\u000a\u000aSmaug is fantastic. CGI, voice, story, everything about him. Nuff said. But he does not carry the movie. His part in it starts well into the second half, and that is not enough to make him carry it.\u000a\u000aThe sets are (as usual in middle earth) amazing. Especially Lake Town this time. Knowing the behind the scenes from LotR, I'm sure they just built a very small section and shot from different angles to create an illusion of size. Still impressive.\u000a\u000aCONCLUSION?\u000a\u000aThis trilogy should have been two films, not three. The second film is an artistic liberty that should not have been granted. It does not qualify as a worthy 2.5 hr film. The only things tipping it into 5 stars is Smaug + the visual look of the film. I can imagine the 3d aspect possibly carrying the first half on just that experience, because there are a few action packed scenes. But in 2d the story just doesn't entertain enough for it to work.

VThe six stars that I give this film are all attributable to strength of whatever original material that survives. Peter Jackson and his co- writers have slid down the slippery slope of the Mountain of Adaptation and landed somewhere in the Slough of Fan Fiction. If it were good fiction, I wouldn't have so much of an issue. But it's not. And it's there at the cost of original material left undeveloped.\u000a\u000aI would be surprised, for instance, to learn that the company spent more than 10 minutes screen time in Beorn's house. Jackson doesn't dare leave it out, but he has no idea what to do with it. Likewise with the spider sequence--much of Bilbo's cleverness and resolve in rescuing the dwarfs from the arachnids is eliminated and he's reduced to the plucky hobbit-cum-action hero who for some unspecified reason is the only member of the company able to wield his weapon effectively in the webs.\u000a\u000aEven more disturbing, Bilbo's singular encounter with Smaug, a high point of the book, is cheapened by a full frontal assault by ten of the dwarfs (three of them have been left behind tending the sick Kili whose pretty little elf-nurse is rushing to his bedside after slicing through a commando squadron of orc SEALS). The sequence culminates in Thorin Oakenshield racing in a wheelbarrow along a river of molten gold to stop the dragon before he takes his revenge on the dwarfs by ravaging the irrelevant and dwarf-less Lake Town.\u000a\u000aWhy Smaug can't simply kill all ten of the dwarfs when he's destroyed an entire kingdom full of seasoned warriors only 60 years previously is left to the decimated imagination of an audience overfed on CGI.\u000a\u000aOf course, Tolkien gives a very good reason for Bilbo's escape: Smaug doesn't know what he is and gets distracted by Bilbo's flattery while Bilbo, partially shielded by his invisibility ring, grabs some treasure and runs for his life. But in mega-production newspeak, that sort of thing isn't cinematic.\u000a\u000aI beg to differ. It's mythic, and that makes it cinematic. In Tolkien, the scene is pure Beowulf. A thief steals a few items from the dragon's treasure hoard, and the dragon wakes and wreaks havoc on every living creature in the surrounding countryside. It's practically archetypal. But Jackson and his ilk are superior to archetypes.\u000a\u000aJackson's contempt for his source material is only slightly greater than his contempt for his actors. He has an enviable cast, who are all reduced to doing little more than realize the visual concepts of John Howe and Alan Lee. This, I suppose, at least ensures that the movie has a great look--and, like the first one and the LOTR trilogy, it does. But there's little else. When Martin Freeman is actually asked to act, as he is in the sequences where Bilbo meets Gollum and Smaug, he's quite good, as is Andy Serkis. But there's precious little acting that goes on otherwise. Richard Armitage as Thorin glowers and sneers his way through his scenes, mostly because he's been misdirected (or possibly, more charitably considered, uncorrected) by Jackson. Orlando Bloom shows up as Legolas (no worries, as elves age backwards--or was that Merlin?) and seems even more intent on his image as the cool bad-ass elf hottie than he was in the trilogy (although one wonders how much more he has to work to get laid these days). Even Ian McKellan spends most of the time trying to look either wise and grandfatherly or like a cranky old man, only occasionally sharing a Shakespearean bellow as he rebukes evil in, presumably, elvish or Betazoid or Norwegian or something.\u000a\u000aAs long as they have the look, Jackson doesn't seem to care about what they say or emote. Instead, he gleefully uses the camera to simulate a computer game--and boy howdy, just wait until it comes out. Now, I don't want to seem like a crank. As a game, this one will probably be pretty fun. But crikey, stop pretending it's a movie. Because it ain't. And it ain't the Hobbit anymore, either.\u000a\u000aExcept, like I said, for the parts that remain. The desolation. One can hope that the future will hold a technology that allows users of digital movies to easily cut the film apart and put it back together, perhaps in some semblance of what a REAL version of the Hobbit might actually look like.\u000a\u000aBut until then, we have this. The film reeks of Jackson, Jackson, and more Jackson. Evidently, he wasn't humbled at all by his epic failure to remake King Kong, an endeavor for which he still stands in the shadow of the great Merian C. Cooper like an anemic little boy wearing his soldier-daddy's clothes.\u000a\u000aLiving with that sort of failure must breed bitterness. Too bad he's chosen to take it out on Tolkien, another giant whom he admires but is too arrogant to embrace. Instead, he's taken a great children's classic and marked it like a junkyard dog.\u000a\u000aThe sad thing is that I'll probably go see the third, and buy them all as well. Namarie.

VI read many criticisms of this. Apparently, there is a fundamentalist Tolkien fan club that rivals the Austen group in assailing anyone that deviates from the written word; by this I mean the last rewrite of Tolkien's\u000a\u000aI never could finish any of the books. What enthusiasts claim as masterful world-making, I saw as a description of different types of beings with ordinary politics behind unexplained excuses for repetitive quests. So take this comment as one from someone looking for a good film experience rather than for allegiance to the books.\u000a\u000aI think Peter Jackson is important in the world of film. Yes, not a showman or an exploiter. Not even particularly a storyteller but a film visionary.\u000a\u000aLook at this and think about how the space is rendered. The dimensionality of it is striking, in places unique and generally it advances the state of epic cinematography.\u000a\u000aWhen you make a work of art, you at least have to have a central organizing mind to make the world and its presentation coherent. It is not sufficient to borrow the mind of the writer, who is basically a statistician of emotion. Instead, Jackson has given us his own spatial organization, around which this is built. In fact, where Lucas built his own special effects company to render objects, Jackson has created his own, WETA, to render space.\u000a\u000aWe've known the influence of his introduction of dimension in the earlier films. By this I mean both the way depth is used in staging a scene and how the camera moves within that space. You can see a difference in the early films compared to what came before, and the very quick use of similar techniques in other big budget films. It is extraordinary. We are working on a project to annotate and track just such cinematic influence. Some of these non-Jackson films even used his WETA shop.\u000a\u000aHere I think they advanced the art in three ways.\u000a\u000a— Needless to say, we have sets with more vertical dimension and complexity than ever. The final set is amazing, with apparently infinite levels above ground, while simultaneous action is going on in apparently infinite levels underground. The camera seems effortless, but pay a little attention and see that new craft is used in the way the camera is placed and moves to allow us to comprehend where are, where we are going and what is flowing through.\u000a\u000a— Creating a 3 dimensional movie is still bad business. The biggest challenge is that the stereoscopic projection handles movement with depth well only if it is horizontal. Vertical movement just seems jaggy, especially in comparison to the horizontal movement and most especially so when the movement is along the z-axis. The solution to this is to shoot the whole project at double speed. We don't need the extra frames for the horizontal stuff around which cinema evolved. But we do for all the new dimensions WETA is mastering.\u000a\u000a— Adding in vertical action scenes is likely harder than you would think. We have two here that qualify, meaning that they are not just action within a dimensional set, but that the causal dynamics of the action are interwoven with the dynamics of the space. So the battle with the dragon doesn't qualify. The fight with the spiders does, but I believe that uses the paradigm we saw in "King Kong." I cannot check it but I think one of the falls through the trees was blocked quoting a fall by the ape. The new paradigm is the barrel fight; you know they have mastered this when they can insert humor that works.\u000a\u000aI am okay with the inserted love story because it is so pure, archetypal in most ways. The only real problem I have with this visual thrill ride is the way the gold coins were handled. The basic idea is great: merge a complex threatening environment with the complex kinematics of a serpentine being. This is done by merging the flows of the coins with the flows of the dragon. Only WETA would have such an ambitious goal. You can see how they changed story elements around to have Smaug be gold coated toward the end of the sequence and have gold flow from scales. They obviously did not have time to have the gold slake off as flat elements. But long before that they compromised.\u000a\u000aThe way the scales on the dragon move through the sequence is precise, just as plates would. But the way the coins move as objects is not. Coins are disks and packings of coins will have internal alignments making feet shift randomly. The coins when they flow down slopes will combine tumbling with sliding as both sliding and lower locations are lower energies.\u000a\u000aThe point is that we can see that WETA wanted to do something advanced and clever here. But the costs would have been high and the funders didn't see the value. Shucks. Instead we get the coins and random objects rendered using ordinary particle physics — as if they were sand. This is the second major failure in this vein, since the original visionary of "Brave" was fired over the rendering of snow as hair.\u000a\u000aTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.

V*THIS IS TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE WAY THE HOBBIT WAS MADE TO STOP THIS GREAT FILM'S NEGATIVE OUTLOOK BY MANY*\u000a\u000aI loved LOTR and equally I love the Hobbit films thus far. I am writing this to help people see the idea and thinking behind the Hobbit films, so people can have more of an appreciation than a negative view. Firstly the thing behind the LOTR was their was three books, three long detailed books, so almost everything required for script writing was already there and could be interpreted into script and into of course, 3 films. On the other hand the Hobbit was written as a children's book, so, if you have read the book you realise things go by at a very fast pace (like really fast). So when Jackson was writing the film he didn't have much to work with, and yes, there are a lot of events in this short book that people are forgetting about, lots of events but only summarised by Tolkien, too summarised for a comprehensive film. People say he needed one film, but when you think about how fast, the film would go by, you would hardly see anything, and you could miss out on some key scenes and characters. So Jackson had to expand the sequences by using information he brought in from Tolkien's other related texts. My next big issue is pacing... seriously, what a stupid argument, where movie "critics" have to find something to be critical about. For instance in the first film in the Shire, where people said it took to long, for god's sake, the movie is called 'THE HOBBIT', and Hobbit's live in The Shire, I enjoyed this scene immensely as it provides more than adequate characterisation, which for a quality film is important, it provided us with Bilbo's character flaws and habits, the dwarfs mannerisms, beliefs, ambitions, quirkiness, and importantly, individual character points and differentiation. Also showing us Gandalf and Thorins power of presence and importance. The movie breezes along at a steady pace for a first film of a trilogy, which is expected. Also people say that the LOTR is more important, or interesting, thing about it... one is to save the whole world, the other to kill a dragon and take back a kingdom, so please stop comparing the two films, they have their similarities but also have profound differences, pros and cons. People have been saying he (Peter Jackson and his associates) verged too far from the books but what he did was really quite clever, he allowed us to see more of Middle Earth than ever before, and in an entertaining, clever way. Thank you Sir.\u000a\u000aSo please before you go and say something negative about these great films (which I highly recommend above all other films at this point), just think about what has gone into these films and why and also show a certain appreciation for these magnificent films.\u000a\u000aAnd once I again I would like to re-iterate that you go see The Hobbit Desolation of Smaug, filled with awesome characters, mind blowing scenery, fantastic acting and direction for Peter Jackson. This film,is great fun for all ages and I urge you to see it. \u000a\u000aThankyou

VThis movie is exactly how Tolkien's Hobbit should not be. After first part I asked myself if screenwriters ever read book, now I ask myself did they ever read any book. This dialogs in movie mostly fit some early developed Japanese rpg games with bad simplified English translations, story fit them good too(that much good fits, that you do not even need to read it, just press button on gamepad to skip dialogs and continue to fight bad guys). After this movie I expect to see Conan the Barbarian played by Adam Sandler in 3rd part of movie, Justin Bieber as Batman, and why not put justice league in 3rd movie? Iron man will fit Tolkien's middle earth world, same way as all you put so far fit. Really is this parody? Or your screenwriter really think that they can compete with Tolkien? Even G.R.R. Martin can't compete with him, nor any writer in last 80 years in this genre ever made success that much that can stand near Tolkien, but barely literate screenwriters you engaged think they can? Really I played games with better dialogs, and better story, even if this is game(because it looks mostly like video game), it would be bad one. I really like not just Tolkien's book also G.R.R Martin's and a lot of other, even Terry Prattchet's world seems more realistic than this movie. Jumping on heads of dwarfs in barrels, Really???? Poison Arrow? Dragon can only be killed with specific arrow and special balista? Bard as secondary main character, and it should be completely opposite, accident bowman guard that kills dragon, Legolas I Tauriel or whatever her name is why are they here? Tell us this is Parody or please have respect to Tolkien and change the name of your movies. Tolkien became unit of measurement for good fantasy it should not be changed it should be a constant I'll give you example: Game of thrones is 0.8 Tolkiens, Wheel of time is 0.4 Tolkiens, your LOTR is 0.8 Tolkiens, and your Hobbit is 0.001 Tolkien.

VHaving literally been counting the months down to this release, I finally watched the film at the IMAX in 3D. An avowed JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson fan, this was always going to be a difficult one to deliver, having set the bar so high in the previous films. I so wanted to enjoy this but it was just not to be, even when viewed through such "positively biased" eyes as mine. OK, the original Hobbit had a few mistakes in my opinion; the "mockney" accents and dialogue of the Stone Trolls seemed to be aimed at the under 10's and the misjudged song of the Goblin King aside, there was still enough quality material to keep you hooked, captivated and entranced by the sheer beauty of the language, the cinematography and the plot. This, however, was a different animal. Whilst, still on occasion, certain sets and visuals were almost breathtakingly stunning, including the detail in the rain soaked opening scene at Bree, the bulk of the movie felt like a cross between a made for TV sci-fi and a super lifelike video game. New characters introduced failed to have much depth, and the inclusion of Stephen Fry, playing Stephen Fry was a huge mistake on the same scale as Eli Roth playing the Bear Jew in Inglorious. Parts of the action seemed to have elements of incredible reality quickly intermingled with clear CGI falseness, which just made it difficult to watch. Most of the fantasy scenes in previous offerings were successful largely because they were believable - these just felt false through and through. I could go on....The accents of certain characters, the choice of casting in parts, the decision to have the dragon talk at such length and in such a style (think Ka the snake in Jungle Book) was all just wrong, wrong, wrong. I will be there in 12 months to watch the final conclusion and hope it proves a fitting end to the Trilogy. LOTR and the Hobbit IS undoubtedly a fantasy tale; but that does not mean that it needs to be reduced to a version of a Harry Potter film to make it work.

VThis movie was so bad I kept on checking what time it was. The story was abysmal and the 3D didn't add much to it, it only made it worse. At the end of the movie I wished I watched the 2D version or didn't watch it at all. I really respect all the special effects and the CGI but the LOTR/Hobbit team has proved their CGI skills a million times and I think it should be about time for them to make one step further. A step towards good story, for instance. \u000a\u000aNot even trying to compare the mediocre Hobbit to the great Lord of the rings, I usually like these movies because they are versatile, the story is deep, there seems to be a certain atmosphere around them and there's values that the movies try to portray, there's usually a message it wants to give to you; here there was none of that. The one sub-plot that I got into got totally disfigured by the amount of time it spent off the storyline and by the violently cut ending. \u000a\u000aThe story got totally overwhelmed by the action, and I really felt like I could get action elsewhere. It just felt like the movie didn't have an edge, didn't try to bring anything new to the table, just stick with the same old formula and adding a pointless 3D, trying to make up for the story... the characters were lifeless, and very sadly, in 3D, the world was lifeless too. The thing that happens with 3D is that it isn't evolved enough and it cannot substitute a good 2D cinematography, because in 2D cinematography we can see different composition, colors, angles, while 3D brings messy (too dark!) colors, all-over the place angles and no composition can be seen whatsoever. I would much more appreciate the rich colors and the amazing world of 2D New Zealand.\u000a\u000aIt was just the kind of movie you could make a parody out of. Too many last-moment salvages from orcs, inconsistent action sequences, way too much talking (especially the self-glorification of the dragon) and way too much music... way too much of everything as a matter of fact.\u000a\u000aI think the novel got pummeled in the face of money, that was seen in people who will watch it out of habit. OK, obviously it had to be done, but they could have done it with more soul. And pretty ironically, I think money, greed and losing soul to darkness - kind of a mirror of our own world - are the main symbols of the LOTR and Hobbit series. And I hold a grudge to this movie because it didn't try to give anything new to the spectators (when we leave aside the expectedly thrilling world, which has been delivered so many times in this series), but a couple of good action sequences and a wannabe love-plot. It was all over the place. If I tried to make a summary, I couldn't. \u000a\u000aI liked Evangeline Lilly though.\u000a\u000aCall me critical, but 4/10

VCome on.\u000a\u000aI wrote this summary after a good guy knocked out an orcs with an elbow to the face (when the orcs was behind him). Hitting enemies while facing the other way is realistic....lol.\u000a\u000aElves in melee range just shoot the orcs in the face. No problem. Machine gun elf arrows kill orcs who don't seem to notice.\u000a\u000aThe orc leaders just growl and say "after them!". Since orcs get massed slaughtered in melee range, and don't catch on, maybe they all should just shoot arrows and actually do something ffs lol? The fat short dwarfs out run danger without a problem. All the stupid scared looking faces will not stop this from looking STUPID.\u000a\u000aThey did nothing to add to the story, they added violence but with good guys this strong, there is no real danger. Clearly they think their audience is gullible morons, eager for some crap stew, and they are ready to cash in!! No tension, no surprise, no personality, no danger, lots of melodrama, nothing interesting to say, cheesy action, incompetent bad guys, this movie is more like "Home Alone" than it is anything worth remembering.\u000a\u000aCant wait for this trash to drop down to a real rating and not the fake spam rating of the people who made the film. I've seen cartoon versions of the Hobbit that were better than this!

VAfter reading all the positive reviews before I watched the movie, I was fairly optimistic The Hobbit trilogy took all those much needed adjustments in direction and fixed the problems of the first movie. Unfortunately I've let my hopes fly too high yet again.\u000a\u000aWithout going in any details about the story, the movie felt like an unsatisfying mess. The biggest problem for me is its identity crisis. In general I consider myself a very open-minded movie goer as long as the movies are fully aware with their purpose, direction and the reason why the audience are going to enjoy it. Even bad movies per se can be good in the sense that they may not pretend to be anything other than bad. So the audience takes the movie on its face value and enjoy it for what it is.\u000a\u000aWith the hobbit I just can't understand what the makers tried to achieve - it's a bit of a child book story but with some gore and violence and dark epic tones. As a story driven movie where character development is in the background, the pacing is slow and without a clear direction. I can't believe the same team made the classic that is The Two Towers as well as the rest LoTR movies. The movie I felt is very comparable to other PJ's works like King Kong, which again wasn't character driven and the pace was too bad and ruined the movie. \u000a\u000aThe second movie was the defining one for this trilogy. The ton has been already set and its too late to backtrack with the 3rd one. Such a shame really...

VThe first installment of the Hobbit at least was kind of okay as an action movie, even if it mangled the book. This time, the person next to me nudged me and asked whether I wanted to leave about one and half hours into the film. I was tempted. Very tempted but stuck it out. However, by the time it was finished, it was a relief it was over.\u000a\u000aI am not going to repeat all the same points from my review of the first Hobbit film, but instead will think of a 'what if?' scenario.\u000a\u000aWhat if Jackson had made a single film, about two and a half hours long (or three?) and had stayed true to both the spirit of the book and the story? You see, the book has sold year in and year out for decades. This is because it is a VERY GOOD STORY. Just think about what could have been made.....it was possible that he could have made a classic film that would stand the test of time of decades of being watched and loved, and would have sealed his reputation as one of the greats.\u000a\u000aDo not get me wrong - I love dumbass action films. My enduring recent favourite film is Battleship. I like action, I like fantasy, I like fun films. However, instead of any of these, we are fed a bloated, overblown version of the story. As an analogy, Jackson had a recipe to make a gourmet rib eye steak sandwich and instead chose to mince the steak to make a Burger King Whopper.....\u000a\u000a....and whilst a beautiful rendition of a steak sandwich may be remembered, who remembers a Burger King dinner....it kinda satisfies for a short while, but in the end it is just junk.

VOK so people are allowed to take artistic licence to "adapt" stories for the screen but this interpretation of The Hobbit felt like it was written after just reading the blurb on the back cover of the source material. The book is a best seller for a good reason - the film makers, while capable of the visually stunning, have to my knowledge not achieved international renown as novelists so more respect should have been paid to the book.\u000a\u000aIn many ways the same could be said for LOTR but I felt that despite deviating from the books and the terrible casting, the characters were well developed and the additional plot lines weren't terrible.\u000a\u000aIn The Hobbit it felt like the mix was about 30% original story and 70% new content - none of which added anything and in most instances led to drawn out pointless scenes that just slowed the film down and made it drag painfully.\u000a\u000aWhen it wasn't dragging through these badly scripted scenes there was plenty of action but there was just too much CGI that blurred past and it got a bit tedious.\u000a\u000aMy two teenage boys thought it was great but I just can't see how adults who have any grounding in either film history or the Tolkien literature could enjoy this adaptation.

VThis 2nd Hobbit movie shows the weakness of turning a 300-page children's book into a full blown 8-hour movie trilogy, an expansion which was unarguably done for commercial and not artistic reasons. There's not enough material in the book for a trilogy, so everyone at New Line had to make stuff up to get three movies out of it.\u000a\u000aMy suggestion is to read the book before (or after) you watch the movie. Consider how extra content added to the film changes the story. In addition to creating mindless action scenes for the sake of entertainment, they reshaped existing characters into heroes and insert new heroes into the story, which was not written to be so grand or epic.\u000a\u000aIt would be okay if they called this "a film inspired by The Hobbit", but calling this film "The Hobbit" is just wrong.

VWhat makes The story of the Hobbit is it's beauty in simplicity. The story is pretty simple, but it has deep characters with great story telling, and interesting foes along the way. I was my favorite book growing up. Desolation of Smaug convolutions all that and ruins (arguably) some of the best parts of the book. 1) The added Orc guy chasing them... is stupid. It's not in the book and is TOTALLY unnecessary.\u000a\u000a2)One of the funnest parts of The Hobbit is seeing the wisdom and trickery of Gandalf. The way he tricks Beorn to extend hospitality to his party is so awesome... but not in the movie. They do it totally wrong and stupid. It cheapens the character of Beorn. \u000a\u000a3) The dialogue between Bilbo and Smaug was another GREAT part of the book that this movie totally takes a huge stinky Carl's Jr dump on (like after a Western Bacon cheeseburger and fries type dump). Bilbo NEVER went fully into the room with the dragon. He hid in a chamber and had excellent banter with Smaug. Smaug tried to lure him out and tried to roast him with fire... but Bilbo in the passage escaped. The movie goes over the top with Biblo out running a freaking dragon!! It's not believable and cheesy and stupid.\u000a\u000aSo in closing... Dear Peter Jackson... your an idiot. If you want to make a movie about a book... write your own freaking book and then ruin that. You ruined the book. 0 stars.

VGreetings all, \u000a\u000aI am afraid to say this is exactly what I have come to expect of this franchise, something that is mediocre and nothing more. Admittedly an improvement tenfold on it's predecessor, yet somehow it manages to deliver the same disappointing aspects.\u000a\u000aThe first installment was overly long and this is no different, we're treated to some rather lacklustre performances through both the generic cast of dwarfs and the repetitive action sequences.\u000a\u000aIt comes to pass that we're watching a film where we as a viewer, predominantly, care not for the characters of which it is comprised. Save for a few convincing portrayals in Martin Freeman, Luke Evans and Lee Pace to be exact, who gallantly redeem the feature with their utmost ability.\u000a\u000aThe clarity and visuals are one aspect that most definitely deserve praise, but then again it's a small feat to make something look good, while leaving it devoid of any other defining trait.\u000a\u000aIf you've watched the first, you might as well give this one a try as it is, if nothing else, a slight improvement. Unfortunately I suspect you'll be left with a bad taste in your mouth, especially when you reach the climactic act and namesake of this film arises as a bumbling, egotistical fool.\u000a\u000aOh Smaug, the enormity of the mistake it was to churn out a little more gold instead of letting sleeping dogs lie is becoming apparent. I can only hope the final chapter is more exciting and less yawn inducing.

VI am not much of a Tolkein fan, but I saw the original LOTR film trilogy and read The Hobbit, and enjoyed all of it. The first Hobbit film was weak, but tolerable and full of atmosphere, but The Desolation of Smaug is downright awful.\u000a\u000aI am not against making changes to a film's source material, that is, if it benefits the film or makes for a solid, entertaining story. The screenplay here is a big mess, with too many conflicting subplots which take away from the central story about the dwarfs making their way to the mountain. Why do we need that subplot with Azog? Or a bunch of needless tie-ins to the original trilogy? Or a silly love triangle which does little to contribute to anything? It's a shame that so much screen time is taken away from Martin Freeman, who without doubt gives the best performance.\u000a\u000aThe CG is especially horrendous and had me laughing aloud at several moments. The action sequences are so overblown and cartoonish. And why does Legolas' horse need to be CG?? Really? Does everything need to be a special effect? You cannot tell me they could not afford a real horse for just that one tiny shot! It's ridiculous.\u000a\u000aAt least this film wasn't Star Wars prequel bad, but that's about it.

VI grew up with my imagination and Tolkien stories. My sisters and I were all playmates with our favorite Elven characters (it was the flowing dresses) and we wore out the VHS tape of the original Hobbit cartoon.\u000a\u000aIt's hard when someone makes a book into a movie, because no two people read a book the same. As much as I enjoy some of the aspects of the directors decisions for this movie and his others, there are things I detest greatly.\u000a\u000aThe hobbit was always a rather happy story in my eyes. Yes, there were bad things, but I never saw it this way. It was treasure and battle, swords and arrows, saving the day etc. Instead, there is a very dark twist to these movies, and again, perhaps that's how the director read it. I will watch all three, and inevitably purchase them, and raise my children with the book first and then the movie...and hope that some day, maybe 20 or 30 years from now, someone finds it in themselves to re-do these glorious books, and we can all have a different experience again.

VI liked the movie overall, but in the end I felt that everything was rushed and little was presented...\u000a\u000a1. I don't understand how a book presented in three 3h movies can seem so rushed... The meeting with Beorn was quick with no tension, no detail, no nothing. The journey through mirkwood was dull, a mere 2 minutes of wandering and then they jumped directly to the spider fight... The barrels escape came from nowhere. In the Lake town they were caught and they were gone. The search for the keyhole was stupid... Why the need of the light of the moon if they had a staircase which led to a wall smaller than one wall in my room where all they needed was to search a little for a hole? The story from inside the mountain seemed a totally different thing than the book... What was the story with the Lake chief? What is Gandalf doing, and why are the orcs here better armored (in the end) than in LOTR? \u000a\u000a2. Fighting scenes are overly exaggerated... Probably influenced by LOTR. They get overly creative with all angle arrow shots and creative decapitations by Legolas.\u000a\u000a3. The CGI is disappointing... There are a few scenes which seem taken from a video game. The orcs do not look real. There Is a scene where the orcs run over a lake bridge and Legolas follows ahorse when the riding doesn't seems at all natural. \u000a\u000aThe best thing the movie did was to make me read the book again, to remember the real details...

VI'm no Tolkien purist and I absolutely don't care how the main orc is called ... Azog or Bolg, as IMHO it's not very important for the story itself. But I do care if the movie carries no resemblance to the book except for the names of the main characters. The first movie was, apart from the few action scenes, relatively true to the book. And I enjoyed it. But this one.... PJ has ruined the best four scenes from the book that I was really excited to see. First, Gandalf introducing dwarfs to Beorn, then, Bilbo taunting the spiders, third, dwarfs escaping from the elven cave (or better, the whole few weeks of their imprisonment), and finally (my favourite), witty conversations between Bilbo and Smaug. What disappointed me the most, was that endless chase in the Lonely mountain. I really don't see the point of inventing that scene. If any of the characters got killed there, I would just go: "Eeh, so what!" These and the whole bunch of stupid plot changes and pointless battle and action scenes ruined the movie for me. And I'm certainly not going to watch the third movie, as I'm sure there will be even more stupid action, probably a whole three hours of fighting. I actually went on and read the whole book in English as, until then, I have only done it in my native language to see if I had read badly translated Slovenian translation. As I was (far too late) exiting the cinema I kept asking myself: "WHY, WHY, WHY?!! did you have to ruin the book??"

VHalfway through this movie I began to wonder if someday someone would make a film about Tolkien's book The Hobbit. This movie isn't it. I felt addled by the action sequences and was left wondering why Jackson would create them out of thin air and then leave out genuine scenes from the book. Was the original story not good enough? And why does he have to demonstrate over and over that SAURON IS COMING! THE DARKNESS IS LOOMING! Please, we already know that this story precedes the Lord of the Rings (a great movie trilogy, by the way--you should see it). Like the first installment, this movie is geared toward fans of violent sports and video games. It's not Tolkien's light-hearted, imaginative, intelligent Hobbit. Someday...

The acting, sets, makeup and costuming also seemed cheaply hurried. The green screen scene backdrops looked amateurish when contrasted with the real NZ scenery.\u000a\u000aThey seem to be going overboard in selling the NZ scenery - does the studio have holdings in tourist oriented money making?

VAs a lover of all things Tolkien, I'm vastly disappointed with the 2nd installment of The Hobbit. It seemed like "filler" and thankfully my ticket was only $8.00. In fact it had very little substance from the actual book. Apparently the film relies on special effects, characters, and scenes that are entirely superfluous. It's a pity that producers are more concerned with box office returns than actually making a true work of art. No attempt was made to be true to the written word of the literary master that was J.R.R.Tolkien. \u000a\u000aThat said, one thing I must say in Peter Jackson's favor; introduction of materials from the appendices can be pertinent and interesting. I don't mind him doing this at the time of his choosing either. \u000a\u000aThe earlier installments of The Lord of the Rings had their detriments as well but taken as a whole, they far surpass the first and definitely the second installment of The Hobbit. \u000a\u000aBasicsally The Desolation of Smaug is a romp for an ADHD modern audience. I'll stick to the book.

VThe Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug review: It contains lots of actions, lots of them. However, every time I watch LOTR, there are scenes where I always feel teary. The Hobbit feeds on the glory of the LOTR. Still, it's completely emotionless. Completely. The chill of "Far Over the Misty Mountains Cold" is now long gone, hobbit 2 is now just a hack and slash action movie, where you'll find yourself caring for nobody. The first movie was much better than this, which really had some emotional moments. Hobbit 2 destroyed even its predecessor. I earnestly hope Hobbit 3 keeps up with the spirit of the great Lord of the Rings. Middle earth is the land of dreams and fairy tales. Please let not ruin them with meaningless actions.

VI'm not a professional reviewer but a devoted Tolkien fan. I don't mind taking liberties in telling a story but to discard most of the book and then add a senseless love interest between an elven character not even in the book and one of the dwarfs is a travesty. I did enjoy Jackson adding some history to LOTR but not enough to make three movies. I gave the movie three stars as the action was fun if a little far fetched but this is fantasy. I had high expectations after LOTR but Jackson writes his own stories and leaves out much of the story I loved. The road through Mirkwood was supposedly a major road from the past, not some winding trail. There was no feeling of the amount of time that was passing. Mirkwood is over 200 miles wide and should take weeks to cross, not hours. I was really looking forward to Bilbo taunting the spiders only to be disappointed. The stay in the woodland elves prison was for many days not a few hours. And to make Bard a barge man and not the captain of the guard makes no sense. This seems more an effort to sell tickets than tell a story.

VIt took me about two days to go through this movie. I saw half one night, got tired and watched the rest the next day. Sadly it was a very forgetful experience. It seemed like the whole movie was about the Dwarfs getting captured, miraculously escaping, getting captured again, magically escaping, getting captured once again, escaping somehow, etc. It just got too redundant quickly. Not to mention the movie is well over an hour longer than it should have been. When it ended I was relieved, kinda like the feeling you get when you leave the DMV after waiting around all day to get your license or registration renewed.\u000a\u000aJackson really blew it with this movie. My wife, who loved LOTR fell asleep through this movie. She didn't care what happened at the end.

VThey completely changed the story from the books and original movies which ruined Smaug's introduction. True readers and lovers of the books will be more than disappointed when Smaug has his entrance. The scene didn't just veer from the story like most movies do, the plot entirely was changed and not for the better. It slightly changed the whole premise of the movie. Thorin and the dwarfs should have NEVER entered the cave and the attempt with the gold made no sense. Not to mention they completely slaughtered Smaug's speech by breaking it up and destroying the power that should have been portrayed. Also, Smaug was not to even see Bilbo until the very end of the speech, instead Bilbo's location was known the whole time defeating the purpose of the ring aspect and Smaug never smelling hobbit before. It's absolutely ridiculous how "creative writing" is used so loosely and can ultimately ruin a movie that had such great potential.

VI have and always shall be a Tolkien Lover.\u000a\u000aI use Mr. Spock's to show my solidarity to legacy of the The Hobbit story. I have two perspectives in which I'd like to share.\u000a\u000aAs a teacher: This volume of the story deviates so much from Tolkien's text that a lot of the themes that I want to convey- the difference between perception and reality (the value of Bilbo's transformation) and the politics of the human world (leaving out Elvish derivations; I did not know of the caste Elvish system short of Thingol's value of his daughter's hand). I find that the connections of the story make MUCH more sense in terms of holding a realistic and thoughtful discourse on the actions of the Elvenking and the Master of Laketown.\u000a\u000aAs a fan of the series: I cannot believe the minute (minute as 'small') treatment of Beorn and the importance he will later play in the saga- this is just a singular case in how this 'movie' treats the seems to minimize the real drama in this portion of the text (the epic traverse of Mirkwood, the stealth needed to escape the Woodelves' Realm and the feelings of hopelessness on the northward journey from Laketown and most importantly the journey of Bilbo toward the innermost chamber). I can think of a dozen endings better then the 'foe' (spoken literally) ending of the dwarfs fighting Smaug himself (my gosh, could they not have left it where Bilbo first meets the beast or where Bard slays him?) The need to develop Azog is misguided- they do not need a tangible need of his influence in every scene. AND FINALLY WHY MY GOSH ALMIGHTLY DO THE NEED ANOTHER LOVE STORY TO MINE? I was able to deal with the Aragron-Arwen saga because at least there was backing text to support it, but this fabrication stands as just a disgusting way to drub up a plot-line.\u000a\u000aThe Verdict: I feel that The Hobbit, as a three-part is just a way to maximize ticket-sales and pimp out a beloved and moving story that could serve (tastefully edited) a compelling and interesting story. This movie is a joke and I cannot believe that The Tolkien Society or other real fans would enjoy this installment of the story. IT IS A SHAME!

VI had high hopes for this one. The first one was fair. There were problems, but all in all a good effort. This was the place where they would either bring it back or go completely in the wrong direction. Unfortunately, they went completely in the wrong direction. The Hobbit story is a good story. I read it when I was young and I know many others who did or at least tried as well. They only criticism I'd ever heard was that Tolkien could be a little dry. But it was a good story and there was no need to change it so drastically. I understand that they were trying to develop subplots in order to extend the story and stretch it into 3 movies, but please. I wonder if the people responsible for writing the screenplay ever actually read the book or just the Cliffs Notes version. If they had actually read the book, they would have seen that there was plenty of story there for 3 movies without ruining the story. But they didn't. So yes, they ruined the story. I don't post a lot of reviews, but in this case I couldn't resist. I guess we'll have to wait for someone else to come along perhaps 30 or 40 years from now to do it right. Until then we can watch the animated version and pretend this movie doesn't exist.\u000a\u000aI gave it a 6 because the visuals and effects were very cool. The dragon was great. 6 might be generous. I give it about a 4 for what they did to the story and 8 for visuals. The average is 6..

VI've never been a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings. Never been able to care enough about the characters and whether they lived or died. There wasn't one actor in this able to carry a film for 20 minutes, let alone the time this ran for. Things improved a bit when the elves were involved but I was just hanging out for this to end for the last 30 minutes. My son didn't like it either and he's a fan. I got the feeling that the director felt he had to somehow make it a long film and totally lost me in the process. There seems to be two story lines, one with the dwarfs in and one with Ian McEllan. He could have made two reasonable films. Instead he's made a mishmash and one awful one.

V"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" is the second of three films depicting Tolkien's "The Hobbit". It's directed like the Lord of the Rings films and the first hobbit movie by Peter Jackson again and also features many of the actors from the previous movies. I have to say, I enjoyed the first Hobbit film quite a bit, so I was certainly eager to see this one. Unfortunately, it left me slightly disappointed. It's not much worse than the first and has certainly a handful interesting sequences, but as a whole somehow I wasn't really wowed. The usual criticism about these films is that the book is simply too small to justify three very long movies and while I have been so far of the opinion that it's actually possible to make three good films, this movie has gotten me closer to really understanding the previously mentioned criticism. Also I wouldn't have minded if Jackson had included simply additional characters or story lines to fill the time or just had kept the films below the 100-minute-mark.\u000a\u000aThe first 100 minutes of "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" really really dragged a lot and none of the characters were interesting enough to keep me particularly interested. Had it gone on like that, my rating would have been considerably lower, but thankfully the film really gained steam the moment Smaug wasn't only talked about, but actually entered the picture from the very moment Bilbo stepped into the treasure chamber. This was also a Sherlock reunion for Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman and easily the highlight of the film. The visual effects were fantastic, the treasure chamber with all the gold and coins and jewels was the perfect setting for this very one-sided face-off and I enjoyed every minute of it. I just wish the other parts of the film could have been equally good. However, the love story, the sickness parts or even the motivational moments such as the dwarfs trying to get back their home didn't seem convincing to me at all, sometimes even cringeworthy sadly. Not even Gandalf could really win me over with his scenes although they were certainly among the better ones from the film just because the character is so memorable. The goblin creatures were scary, but I felt they could have been even more intimidating. One really big problem I had with this film was the change of Bilbo. While Freeman did a solid job in portraying him, I just couldn't believe the transformation he took so quickly, even if a lot of it came from the ring, how he rescues everybody from the elves thanks to his wit and speed or how he kills dozens of giant spiders. He felt almost like he James Bond of Middle Earth at some point, not a credible character development looking at how anxious he was just shortly before all his heroic deeds. The aforementioned spider scene is definitely nothing for people with arachnophobia or maybe especially for these if shock therapy may be the right thing. Even I was quite intimidated during that part and the part with the giant spider is also one from the Lord of the Rings films I remember the most.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I think they could have easily cut 45 minutes from the second film of the Hobbit trilogy and it would not have hurt the overall picture at all, probably even helped it without some of the less interesting parts. The scenes with Smaug really saved the film from being a complete disaster. Besides that I also liked Stephen Fry in his small part, but I totally love the man and think he's a complete genius, so this may just be personal perception. Here and there, the movie had interesting references back (or forward, I shall say) to Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's not enough to grant a really high rating. I truly hope, the final chapter around Christmas 2014 will be better again.

VAbsolutely the worst BS that Jackson has done to date....even worse than the first installment of The Hobbit (and I did not think that was possible.) Anyone giving this a positive review is not only lying to you, but is helping the film company steal your money.\u000a\u000aThis is soooo bad, that I'd advise you to not even watch it when it is rentable.\u000a\u000aBecause that moron Jackson created that chase scene in the first installment, he had to continue it in this one.\u000a\u000aOrcs fighting the elves in Mirkwood, orcs fighting in laketown, a few of the dwarfs staying in laketown while the rest go to the Lonely Mountain.\u000a\u000aOther BS like Legolas being in this film......Gandalf (alone) vs Sauron, The action scenes... totally bs ..... from the fighting scenes to the dragon ..... astonishingly stupidly done.\u000a\u000aForget the fact that there should be no fight scenes between Thorin's group and Smaug........ this dragon that was able to totally devastate 2 towns/communities (Dale and the Lonely Mountain ) .... is now unable to kill a dwarf or halfling when right in front of it....\u000a\u000aBecause he screwed around with ",,,,five fir trees" in the first movie, AND had that ongoing, nonsensical chase continuing..., Jackson has to come up with some moronic method to get Beorn into the movie .... and moronic it is....\u000a\u000aIf you like the book, don't waste your time.... and if you like action movies..... why not find something like "The Seven Samurai" or an Errol Flynn classic like Prince and the Pauper...?

VI read this book as a ten year old and it really affected me in the most positive way a book can. But I'm not a purist and I understand scriptwriters need to alter and change things a little to make it work on the screen. Ill admit I'm not a fan of Jackson, I've never truly enjoyed any of his movies, there always was an over reliance on special effects, whether it be old fashioned or cg effects, they always took center stage to the detriment of storytelling. I had issues with his LOTRs movies but most people enjoyed them for what they were and that was fine with me, I just wont be watching them again, once was enough.\u000a\u000aThe Hobbit on the other hand is so bad that I feel like smacking Jackson round the earhole for his butchery of a wonderful and inspiring book. He messed it up catastrophically , its all there in the book just follow it and do the best you can, alas peter saw dollar signs and awards and his name in lights once again, and for that he deserves a left boot into the chops. I wont talk it through scene by scene many others have and have done better than I can, probably because I had a brain seizure with all the flashing images and had to be resuscitated, ill just mention mirkwood, in the book there was a overwhelming sense of the vastness of the forest, one got the feeling it would take weeks to walk to the other side, that it was truly ancient and alive and that they were being watched constantly by malevolent things in the shadows, things more evil than Jackson's underwear hamper, the dwarfs are completely without hope and its a grim and dark chapter in the book , Jackson spends 10 minutes in mirkwood and made it look a cheap set with bits of awful cg with trees that look like painted Styrofoam and spiders that were about as scary as a daddy long legs

VI say this as a Tolkien fan who read The Hobbit several times as a boy and recently read it to my daughter, with much enjoyment, and has read The Lord Of The Rings several times, twice as an adult. I adore the LOTR films, where Peter Jackson and his writing collaborators (Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens) worked wonders to get a coherent screenplay out of that massive, unwieldy tome. He jettisoned whole chunks of plot and characters - Tom Bombadil, the barrow wight, orcish politics - and few reasonable Tolkeinophiles could complain, as these omissions were clearly intended to streamline the story. Personally, my main regret is the absence of The Scouring Of The Shire, the riveting coda to the adventure of The Ring, in which the hobbits return to the Shire and put right the wrongs that have been perpetrated in their absence.\u000a\u000aMore controversially, Jackson made some radical changes to the story: Elves At Helm's Deep! Arwen's part beefed up! Tolkein would undoubtedly have deplored such meddlings with his text, and his son and literary executor Christopher, when breaking a lifetime's silence to give an interview in 2012 made his feelings clear. And yet, the appearance of a battalion of Elves to strengthen the beleaguered garrison at Helm's Deep somehow feels right, and is not at all implausible in the context of previous alliances between Elves and Men. And while one motive for beefing up the part of Arwen was undoubtedly to give the film more female interest, the love between Arwen and Aragorn is not an idle fancy of the writers, being detailed in the Appendices.\u000a\u000aUltimately, the fact remains that there is a huge wealth of material in the Lord Of The Rings, and the big questions for the writers concerned what to leave out. But then there were well over a thousand pages (in small typeface!) to draw on. It was always doubtful, on the other hand, whether wringing three films out of the Hobbit, a far slighter book, would work. After Part 1, I thought he might just pull it off. Although ludicrously overlong, it was a welcome chance for fans to re-immerse ourselves in that beautifully realised world. Some sections, particularly Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, are perfectly realised. Part 2 shows conclusively that Jackson hasn't pulled it off. With The Desolation Of Smaug, the project appears to be holed below the waterline. This is where the inadequacies are made manifest. So thin is the source material stretched here (barely five chapters!) that he's just Made Up A Whole Load Of Nonsense to buff out the time. Parts of it (such as the rolling barrels) look like video game footage, which for all the CGI jiggery pokery of LOTR was never a problem with those films. Those CGI achievements, which were so thrilling, yet spawned so many doleful imitations, have become the master rather than the servant.\u000a\u000aThen there's the matter of the new characters. Tauriel's introduction was doubtless motivated partly by the same concerns behind the decision to make Arwen more prominent, principally a desire to increase the minimal female presence in the story. The trouble is that everything she does is newly introduced material that was not in the Hobbit, and as such its only real raison d'etre is to pad out the films, justifying the ludicrous decision to make three films out of this book - which both Jackson and original director Guillermo del Toro acknowledged is "lightweight" compared to LOTR. Indeed, the decision to expand from two films to three was only made in July 2013, as detailed in the films' Wikipedia entry. It is therefore certain that some of the material in both of the first two films would have been outtakes from a two-film project. There are other problems with the sequences in the Elven domain in Mirkwood: nearly all of the dialogue is laughably portentous, almost parodic of "Tolkein-speak"; Thranduil is played as a camp pantomime villain; and Tauriel's "love triangle" with Legolas and Kili is wholly implausible.\u000a\u000aThroughout, the depiction of the Dwarfs is problematic. Their leader, Thorin, is handsome, noble and vainglorious, and not out of keeping with Tolkein's creation (although Richard Armitage's performance contains rather too much ham for my liking). The others seem to belong to a different film altogether: barely differentiated, mostly farcical, and some with hideous prosthetics. Then there is Radagast the Brown, a character who is mentioned once in The Hobbit and is only briefly in LOTR; while I have no beef in principle with making certain characters more prominent, what Jackson & Co have done to poor, blameless Radagast is turn him into the Trilogy's Jar Jar Binks, an absurd, crusty comic grotesque. In fact, sadly, the Hobbit films are shaping up to have more than just that in common with the Star Wars prequels. I am a little worried about the last film, based as it is on barely 60 pages of the book. In fact, I might hold out for the "compact version" of the films, perhaps one film of three hours or so containing the real meat of the original story. I won't be holding my breath

VOne big factor of Tolkien's universe is emotional aspect and metaphorical meaning of the conflicts going on to the real world. This movie tried too many things but failed to be coherent enough to leave a great aftertaste. There are moments of greatness through dialog, action, cgi and some fragments of great characters. But unfortunately the emotions of a Hobbit or the leadership of Thorin don't get much screen time among the action of Elves. Many good moments, characters are initially built and then the movie leaves them and jumbles between 2-3 parallel story arcs. We don't see enough of Bilbo here and the emotional bond between Bilbo and the dwarfs is almost gone. We had many emotional moments related to loss of homeland and fearless leadership of Thorin in the first installment of the trilogy, but the second installment fails to deliver in that aspect, instead there are some good moments depicting the resurrection of the dark powers. This instead of complementing the Hobbit storyline competed against each other and finally left almost nothing for Freeman. Freeman's natural and eloquent depiction of Bilbo is a treat to watch shorty in the final act. And the Smaug is really menacing with his tyrannical but witty personality. On a technical front, this movie being so reliant upon cgi should have invested more in high quality cgi, the cgi looks artificial in some scenes during the light and shade in some scenes related to motion. The brand name of Tolkien's universe is enough to drag us to the theater and the Producer/Director should have paid more respect with a better thought out and a more authentic storyline.

VFirstly, I haven't seen the Lord of the Rings films but I grew up with The Hobbit as a book, read it and loved it and then I watched the cartoon which I'm sorry to say for all their effort in use of green screen and digital animation excels this film.\u000a\u000aBenedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, talented actors as they are couldn't save this film. That is the problem when you take a 300 page novel and stretch it out into 3 three hour movies. You have pacing problems and simple boredom. I suppose Peter Jackson tried to fill it up by extending the action sequences with the spiders and the Woodland Elves and the escape thereof, etc, etc. but they become quite dull. Having them spend 10-15 extra minutes fighting spiders or figuring out how to use the barrels to escape the elves whom are racists just because.\u000a\u000aLegolas shouldn't exist until later but they wanted a female and what is a film without a love triangle which didn't exist in the book. It got ridiculous the many numbers of what should be fatal accidents they had which turned out to be no big deal. And then 15 minutes was spent trying to determine where the keyhole was in the lonely mountain.\u000a\u000aOnto Smaug. Well, the dwarf kindly advised Bilbo to try not to wake him up. He should of just said "wake him up" for all the good that did for Bilbo went about in his cave like a blundering fool. He even called out hello several times in Smaug's cave which had an echo. Then he tossed a bunch of coins and gold cups around. It's a wonder Smaug didn't wake of five minutes before. The best part of the movie was hearing Benedict Cumberbatch voice Smaug because his voice dominated that section of the film. But for the first half an hour, and yes, the dragon interchange was an hour or so, was just conversation between Bilbo and Smaug about this and that. The ring, Thorin's ego, Smaug's ego, showing off for Bilbo, etc. The inevitable hide and seek occurred. Eventually, it was tedious.\u000a\u000aReally, as I said, the best part of this film was Benedict Cumberbatch giving voice to the dragon so if you want to see that, get the movie, skip to that part and watch it for the rest is just a waste of time and well the three of us walked out with killer headaches and some nausea. Felt like we were on an amusement park ride gone amuck.

VThis film was slightly better than The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey which was just a mess. The battle scenes may appeal to teenage gamers but I found them boring after about 5 minutes. Apparently a lot of the gamers felt the same as me as there was a glow coming from the rows in front from many mobile screens as the owners texts messages and read emails. The film had no beginning and no ending, it reminded me of the Saturday matinees I used to attend as a boy where the Lone Ranger was left hanging over a cliff and you had to come back next Saturday to see if he was rescued. I for one will not be coming back to see the next part of the franchise. Jackson has taken many liberties with Tolkien's simple children's book and there are too many to name, but the hint of romance between elf and the dwarf was not even in the book and was ridiculous to the plot. The film was dark with very few laughs in it. A lot of the scenes gave the impression of having seen them in other movies such as the spiders or Evangeline Lilly with her bow and arrow reminded me of The Hunger Games. I will give this awful movie 1 because it had some magnificent New Zealand views in it.

VThere be spoilers ahead, if you've read the book by JRR Tolkien, and loved it.\u000a\u000aBut to be brutally honest the real spoiler is Peter Jackson, who seems to have decided that the main plot is: \u000a\u000aGet the Bilbo and the Dwarfs from where the eagles left them at the end of film one, and get them to The Lonely Mountain, via Beorn's House, Mirkwood and it's spiders, the elven king's halls, the river, and Lake Town, and have them being chased by Orcs as much as possible, and we need to have Legolas and some elf woman in there, and don't bother too much about anything in the book, think of it as something we can base a computer game on...\u000a\u000aIf you haven't read the book, or just plain don't care about the book, it's probably a great film.\u000a\u000a(Apart from the animation of the thrush, which appears to have been done by someone who has never seen a thrush, or seen a thrush using a stone as an anvil to break open snail shells. Put in the film as an afterthought, quick do some bird hopping around, base it on a bird trying madly to escape from a cage, something like that, frankly who cares? It's significant in the book, but that doesn't matter here and now in this film...)\u000a\u000aLovers of The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien will still have to wait for a proper film of the book.\u000a\u000aThis film is "The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug" - part 2 of an action adventure game in three parts by Peter Jackson, based on the characters in some book that he might have read 40 years ago, and either didn't care about or has no empathy for.\u000a\u000aIt's well done for what it is, but it's not really anything much like part of the The Hobbit that people know and love.\u000a\u000aAnd Mr Jackson, you should be ashamed of that.

Vand ended the agony of having to sit through another minute of this awful movie. \u000a\u000aIf you've got a deep love of endless camera tracking and fly-throughs perhaps you'd enjoy bits of this movie but they might just make your bored or nauseous or both.\u000a\u000aPerhaps you'd be interested in the high frame-rate because you'd like to make it impossible to suspend your disbelief.\u000a\u000aMaybe you're thing is endless, and I do mean endless, cartoon like chases and fight scenes, if so you'll find no end of them to satisfy this need.\u000a\u000aAs far as my experience goes it was one giant mess of a movie that I wish I'd walked out on at about minute 20. Simply terrible.

VI adore Tolkien, and adored the LOTR movies. I didn't have a problem with the departures from the original - different genre, different person at the helm. I don't have a great problem with Jackson departing from the plot of The Hobbit as such, except that the original in no way justifies three movies.\u000a\u000aNo, the problem for me is that the content that has been added is just so dire. There's a weight of unmemorable characters and the interaction feels stilted and wooden. There's even an added romance that's gratuitous and flimsy. The plot makes limited sense, and I spent most of the movie saying "Why are they doing that? But surely they knew that already...? Oh, that's just silly."\u000a\u000aTo add to that, the CGI is pretty unimpressive. At its best - Smaug - it looks like a video game. As its worst, it's ridiculously over- choreographed fight scenes that had me yawning at their predictability - surfing on shields and bouncing on enemies' heads is now compulsory only because we can. This makes for good guys who are able to gallop around dispatching baddie after baddie while never getting a scratch - with one exception, itself neatly sidestepped. This makes for almost zero suspense.\u000a\u000aI was never entirely sure who was supposed to enjoy this movie. The scenes in Dol Guldur add some of the darkness of LOTR, and the spiders of Mirkwood are much more threatening, although Bilbo cuts through them like butter. On the other hand there's romance, there's slapstick, there are pointless shield-surfing fights every few minutes, and needless distracting cameos from LOTR franchise characters.\u000a\u000aFor me, the movie's biggest crime is in its departure, not from the plot of the original, but from its spirit. The Hobbit is a fairy tale, the story of an untraveled young man given a job that takes him on an adventure beyond the confines of a comfortable life, to which he ultimately returns grown and changed. The Hobbit movies seek to make the story over into an epic, a prequel to LOTR, but lose focus horribly whenever they lose sight of Bilbo's journey.

VI've read the book "Hobbit", but I am not going to judge this movie based on it. I am looking on it as a stand-alone title.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed the first movie of the "Hobbit" series, but this one feels like they took the archetype of an action movie and merge it with fantasy environments and characters and here we are. \u000a\u000aActually it hits almost all of the action movie clichés: \u000a\u000a1. Over the top action - check. (Ammount of action was so damn HIGH) \u000a\u000a2.Villain who talks a lot but does nothing - check. \u000a\u000a3. Villain 'Minions' are dealt without even sweating - check. \u000a\u000a4. Love story out of nowhere - check. (Strange that sex was absent, yet) \u000a\u000a5. Logical issues with world where movie takes place. \u000a\u000a6. Invulnerable main characters - check. \u000a\u000a7. No AMMO limits - check. \u000a\u000a8. Perfect aim, agility and placement - check. \u000a\u000a9. No signs of exhaustion - check. \u000a\u000a10. Always ignorant, in the face of danger, authority - check. ...\u000a\u000aYou know what, I love action movies so i don't want them to be compared to this, so I think this movie is best summed up in the title of my review, it is a video game cutscene after you beat the level. \u000a\u000aNext level is loading... I hope it won't be as dull.

VAfter watching The Hobbit DOS for the second time, i have come to realize this is nothing like the book, and i hate Peter Jackson for making this his own story and not honoring Tolkien's work. With Lord Of The Rings, Peter Jackson took the work of JRR Tolkien and made something magical with it. With The Hobbit, it's like Peter Jackson took the book and shoved down the toilet.\u000a\u000aThe movie is a joke. The first thing i want to mention is the Beorn scene. Beorn is showed in this movie 5 minutes, the dwarfs sieges his house and locks him out side. In the book they enter as guests and Gandalf introduces them two by two so that Beorn would not freak out over the amount of dwarfs. I loved that scene, it shows Gandalf's wit and the dwarfs shyness. Not like in the movie when they by force take his house and lock him out. \u000a\u000aThe other thing i hated in the movie is Legolas and Tauriel. They steal time and attention from the movie and i think it was a non wise move from Peter's part to include them. For me, it's like they are this movies main characters, not Bilbo. This just shows of Peter Jackson failure\u000a\u000aThe third thing is, all the physics breaking fighting scenes that's just wastes time. They are not realistic nor entertaining. Just a pain to go through. A good scene when this is shown is the barrel down the river scene. That scene took 20 minutes, and what did really happened? A lot of orcs died by Legolas and Tauriel, who both was in god mode. Then Kili gets shot. That could have been cut down and the time could been used to something much better.\u000a\u000aThe fourth thing is the amount of time Bilbo was shown, there was barely none. He did not really speak to me during this movie, apart from his conversation with smaug which i think, is one of the few good scenes in this movie.\u000a\u000aThe last thing i would like to hate on. Is the dwarfs vs Smaug scene. This everlasting, boring scene makes Smaug looks stupid and that is a something he truly is not. The scene is really just a out stretched ''NANANAN YOU CAN'T CATCH ME, NANANAA'' game.\u000a\u000aI did not like this movie and i think that the world needs to see another director do another movie about Bilbo Baggins adventure, one that's fair and wonderful, just like the book

VThe Hobbit is one of my all-time favourite books.\u000a\u000aBeing slightly disappointed with Peter Jackson's work with Tolkein's books previously, I walked into the theatre with the expectation of some amount of deviance from the book. However, I was not prepared for what I was faced with.\u000a\u000aThe inclusion of an extra character left me scratching my head for quite some time. Tauriel is apparently a Mirkwood elf. She is also apparently a love interest for both Kili and Legolas. I can't understand why Jackson chose to weaken the robust storyline with the inclusion of a love triangle, especially when there is an enmity between Elves and Dwarfs. This vastly underplays the insular nature of the Sindarin Elves and breaks the concepts Tolkein set in place.\u000a\u000aThe inclusion of "hints" towards the future of TLotR were quite distracting and showed that Jackson didn't care if he was playing fast and loose with the time lines. In the books, Sauron wasn't even a whiff of smoke in Gandalf's mind until after he had knowledge of the ring.\u000a\u000aBut most of all, I REALLY had an issue with the dragon being dipped in gold. Isn't it enough that his belly is encrusted in coins? Tolkein provided awesome descriptives of what happened. Why change it to such an extent? \u000a\u000aThis isn't the movie I wanted to watch. I wanted to watch the Hobbit, by J.R.R.Tolkein. Instead, I got the Hobbit Ripoff by Peter Jackson. If you love the book for what it is, this movie may cause unexpected anger.

VI have never spent 2 hours and 40 minutes so wasteful as I did last night watching this movie! I can not believe that the IMDb rating is at 9.1. If it was possible I would undoubtedly give this movie -1. I loved Lord of the rings. Hobbit 2 is such an disappointment. I really thought it would be better than the first one. You sit there, waiting for something to happen. Then suddenly the screen turns black. This movie has one purpose only. PROFIT PROFIT PROFIT PROFIT PROFIT PROFIT PROFIT! I know we have the HD and 3D now, but that does not mean you stop trying!! People are being ripped off without knowing it! I give you all one advice: spend the time it takes watching this movie and do something else!

VThough I'm willing to give the movies a bit of lee-way in terms of adaptation. No movie based on a book is going to be 100% faithful to it's source material, at least not word-for-word. I quite enjoyed the previous "Rings" movies. They were expertly directed by Jackson. He was able to retain the spirit of the piece - and much of it's narrative. Sure, it had it's problems; a little too much CGI in places, some wooden scenes, but overall it was Tolkien's work. With Jackson's second foray into the world of "Middle-Earth", many of the problems with translating books to screen have reared their ugly heads. "The Hobbit" has been ripe for the big screen treatment for years Sadly, much of what made the "LOTR" trilogy charming has been lost in "The Hobbit". My first issue lies with Jackson's choice to make a relatively short novel (If a novel it is) into a 3 part, sprawling epic. This worked with "The Lord of the Rings" because it was, ultimately, a trilogy. "LOTR" is dense with character, story, themes, and back story. "The Hobbit" is a much less fleshed out work and is substantially less complicated than it "sequel". The books share characters and settings - as Tolkien created a World with a rich history, language, peoples et al. "The Hobbit" is more of a traditional fairy-story whereas "LOTR" is an epic. There is a LOT of filler in these movies and it feels like filler. What was already a rather threadbare narrative is now stretched to the point of tearing. Characters are "expanded" or cameo, dialog and scenes are conjured from inference or behave in a manner not consistent with their character. If Jackson had tightened up the story, dropped some of the "wink and nudge" moments, and focused on delivering a solidly told, compelling work more faithful to the spirit of the piece perhaps I would have less of a problem with it.\u000a\u000aMy biggest issue lies with the ridiculous action scenes. Sure,"LOTR" audiences responded to the "cool" action scenes, but they always felt, at least to me, to be the weakest parts of the movies. Now, i'm not talking about the battle scenes themselves but to the obviously CGI- rendered scenes. Used sparingly they can be a nice treat during the action; a memorable moment or bit of fun. However, making almost EVERY scene into an impossible display of acrobatics, dumb luck, and silly cliché only serves to make the rest of the film feel silly as well. "LOTR" didn't focus on the cheap thrills to propel the story, and tried to bring some genuine emotion to scenes. "The Hobbit" tries to juice every bit of cheesy sentiment, action, and spectacle. It's almost insulting, as a fan to be shown this sort of cornball, exaggerated drivel. There are "dick", snot, and drug jokes, overly long and heavy-handed moments of ominousness, scenes of brooding, etc. Nothing feels genuine. I was highly disappointed in these first two "Hobbit" films. I expected a continuation of Jackson's excellent "LOTR" trilogy work. Instead we were treated to an extended exercise is "focus grouped" nonsense. Jackson seems to have left behind ALL of what worked in the "LOTR" trilogy and decided to give the audience what they've come to expect from today's big budget films: Too much CGI, too little story, thin characters, and plenty of lowest common denominator-style "thrills". I found myself thinking, "Are you kidding me?" and "Wow. That is incredibly dumb".\u000a\u000aJackson is trying very hard to make a 6 part film series based on Tolkien's work. Sadly, instead of 6 good movies, he has delivered 3 solid films, and 2 mediocre films. I have NO hope for "The Hobbit part 3". He is padding these films with so much "LOTR" lore and story threads that it is having an adverse effect on what "The Hobbit" is. Yes, the stories are related, but can exist without being duct-taped together - and that's as skillfully integrated as they feel.\u000a\u000aJackson should have learned a lesson from the last prequel trilogy and side-stepped the pitfalls therein. But it feels as if Jackson decided to follow Lucas' footsteps. "The Hobbit" trilogy has failed to capture the feeling or look of "LOTR". It's both surprising and disappointing that Jackson could go from winning the best picture Oscar for LOTR 3 to making such a disappointing, unworthy follow-up. what's worse is Jackson had everything laid out for him. Yes, there was adaptation to be done, but it was already there for him. All he had to do was follow the path he had tread previously. Sure, technology is better now, and new techniques are available, but they should only serve to make these movies better - they seem to have hurt them. I'm not sure how Jackson could have made a WORSE film, but he did. The practical effects should have been a priority over the overdone CGI - both in characters and in scenery. It takes a fantasy film and makes it even more unreal. The CGI - like in many films as of late - destroys it's own "willing suspension of disbelief" by making what we are seeing so utterly unrealistic, it causes the viewer to mentally check-out. Like I said, a bit of this stuff - used sparingly - works and can be memorable. Trying to create an entire film this way just makes it unwatchable.

VAs expected, the second instalment in The Hobbit series disappoints. It almost feels like a rookie filmmaker was at the helm of this production, desperately attempting to emulate the magic of Jackson's Lord of the Rings series. Instead, it really is Jackson orchestrating this mess. He directed, produced and wrote this film, which is quite unsettling considering its inferiority when compared with his usual terrific work. \u000a\u000aThe Desolation of Smaug is executed like a film from the Narnia series. Its narrative is uneven, a portion of its characters are superfluous and it fails in adsorbing the audience; interesting things happen that we should care about, but we don't. That's due to the first film's weak introduction to the story and the characters, who, due to their awful development are impossible to relate too. When Biblo finds himself in danger we should be riveted, held in suspense as he weaves his way out of the situation, rather than distanced and apathetic, which is ultimately how we feel. In my opinion, this apathy stems from the bad writing and equally dull portrayal of Biblo by Martin Freeman.\u000a\u000aJackson tries to force unwanted characters in the face of the audience by putting these characters in scenes that he believes will elicit an emotional response from the audience (when you watch the film these scenes will be apparent). Even so, these scenes are so poorly constructed it is impossible to care. It feels so amateurish, as if Jackson has no control or passion for the story. It's told in such a rushed way that it allows no time to show its heart. Afterwards when you recount the experience, you realise it was an empty film, only a child or the average brainless viewer could truly love it. \u000a\u000aThe Desolation of Smaug is almost lifted by a few brilliant sequences. Smaug himself proves to be the best aspect of the film. No matter how excellent, though, he is not great enough to rectify the remainder of the film. Unfortunately, that scene beneath the mountain is overshadowed by the other faults, including the careless pacing and fake looking, overly vibrant sets that look nothing like the Middle Earth that LOTR had made us accustomed to.\u000a\u000aFor the average viewer, The Desolation of Smaug will be a fairly enjoyable film, albeit easily forgettable. For a film enthusiast, it will disappoint. Though, if you know anything about films, you probably should expect it to. That's not to say it does have not some admirable moments. Jackson just should have done better, he has the talent, and this had so much potential. I'm not sure how he got it so wrong.

VI think this is the worst movie of LOTR+Hobbit series. I found it very annoying and boring. The talents and the luck of hobbits are greatly exaggerated as if in a smurf or Tom&Jerry cartoon. Well, at the beginning of the movie, there was no flashback of the previous episode so I began to think that this was an independent adventure. As one year passed over the previous Hobbit movie and unless you are a keen JRR fan, there is no way to remember where the last episode ended. There are many ridiculous things in the plot. Why did Gandalf disappear when he was needed most at the entrance of that scary forest? Why did he met with the other nutty sorcerer inside the cave of a mountain? And why did Gandalf told him not to follow him after a short while? How did all those hobbits survived the giant spiders without a scratch? It was an insult to Frodo's legendary fight against the spider in LOTR. What was the fight against that dragon? Come ooooon!!! It was 100 times larger than Balrog and those super witty hobbits succeed to dip it inside a huge 5000 Celsius gold bath again without getting a scratch. And this was an insult to Gandalf's legendary fight against Balrog. During all this time, the scenes were interrupted, the fight against the dragon was interrupted at least 10 times because of the stupid chase in the lake city. I don't even want to mention the fight between the orcs and hobbits along the river and the one between the elf and big orc chief in the lake city in which the orc chief should have cracked all his bones. They all deteriorated the charm of the LOTR trilogy. The director should very well read these comments and pull himself together. He may be a great director but he should remember that he is not making independent movies. He is making episodes that are connected to each other and he should not be fooled by the number of spectators.

VLet me first say that the movie would be a fine action film were it not Tolkien's work re-written by feminist hackneyed appeasers, and helmed by an egocentrist, who still hasn't gotten over the fan disapproval of his prior abortion, 'King Kong'.\u000a\u000aWhere to begin...\u000a\u000aI liked the film up until the spiders, but the relentless orc trackers are just overbearing, particularly their covert invasion of Laketown. And turning Laketown into some militaristic police state? Just childish. Did you really need to cast Stephen Fry and his right hand man as some comical bastardized imitation of Theoden and Wormtongue? Laketown was not a destitute slum.\u000a\u000aWomen have enjoyed a succession of strong female leads in many series and movies portraying them as action heroes over the last few decades: Zena Warrior Princess, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Lost Girl's Bo, Lara Croft, Resident Evil's Alice, to name a few. Why did these hipster Hollywood writers feel Tolkien needed a woman's touch? If a male writer took Jane Austin's work and downplayed the female roles to place more emphasis on say, characters who weren't in her books at all, would these same writers think it a positive decision? The elf and dwarf romance angle actually made me ill. In love with a dwarf and Captain of the King's Guard? Please... \u000a\u000aI forgave Jackson his editing and lesser re-writes of the 'Lord of the Rings', because I did enjoy them despite the same screenwriters thumbing their noses at an actual author, in part because I waited many years for quality versions of the books. I can remember McCartney and Lennon wanted to star in a movie version back in the sixties - can you imagine? (Get it?)\u000a\u000aOne other aggravating path they took was turning Smaug into a gabby old washer woman. He is also connected to Sauron by his remarks, and is somehow aware of the power of the ring. These things never happened in the story. Smaug has very limited lines, but sees the situation clearly through his ancient cleverness, and is a power unto himself without any plans to join the Dark Lord, or share power. His limited dialog in the story was tightly written, and thereby more menacing. And that whole chase scene through Erebor was just irritating. If that kind of flame was that close, hiding behind a column would not save you. The fire would suck the air out of your lungs and set them on fire. How was Smaug so effective against the whole of Thrain's kingdom's army, but failed to kill even one member of the company?\u000a\u000aJackson has a way of visualizing most of Tolkien's world, but shouldn't have been involved in the writing, nor his chosen partners, as they failed to re-create what the man gave us in a classic tale. They did an injustice to his memory in their single minded need to make this epic story their own, rather than the man who authored it.\u000a\u000aI read many of these reviews, and it saddens me that our culture gives in to whatever Hollywood puts in front of them, rather than making some noise when we are presented with a lame copy of a wonderful story with plenty of adventure.

Faster-paced with swift sequences of fantastic action and thrills (i.e. a shoot-the-rapids barrel ride cum battle and the spooky voyage thru a forest plagued with giant spiders) and a boost of energy (and shout-out to the fan girls) with newly created 'sheElf' Tauriel (babelicious ass-kicker Lilly) and a more easier to understand plot line overall. The as-expected visuals and effects are even more thorough and despite a few video game like executions continues to be the blue chip mix of state-of- the-art-technology with old-fashioned escapist storytelling. The third and final chapter should be a doozy!

VUsually for the hobbit/LOTR films I would say that it was predictable/clichéd and had a childish story with undeveloped yet, lovable characters but had really nice visuals/cgi which successfully conveyed how epic and grand the story was, which made it entertaining overall. \u000a\u000aIn this "film" however, absolutely nothing happens story wise. It was a painful 3 hour trailer for the 3rd film, which is set to be just a war between Orcs, elves blah blah over a stone. \u000a\u000aThe little substance that was in this film can be summarized in the following paragraph. \u000a\u000aGandalf leads them to a forest. He then decides to go meet the necromancer for some reason. The dwarfs need to reach the lonely mountain by following one path, but manage to stray from it. An army of spiders attack them but they are saved by the elves (Legolas and Tauriel). They are all captured except Bilbo cause hes wearing the ring. He frees them. they make it to the lonely mountain by passing through "lake-town", which they were smuggled into because dwarfs aren't normally allowed. Through that process the audience is told that there is only 1 type of arrow that can pierce the scales of the dragon Smaug. The dwarfs then proceed to kill the dragon by covering it in melted gold. They obviously fail, the dragon gets mad and fly's to lake-town to kill everyone. thats how it ends.\u000a\u000aWhats wrong with the hobbit series so far: 1) ridiculous, almost comical action scenes. These random bunch of dwarfs have inhumane fitness and physical co-ordination. \u000a\u000a2)Pathetic attempt of romance between a hot elf (Tauriel) and dwarf.\u000a\u000a3) In the LOTR series Gandalf was a fatherly figure that proved hope and courage to the hobbits and soldiers against an impossible adversary. This role is completely necessary in this series because the dwarfs and Bilbo constantly achieve physically impossible feats as if it were nothing. On top of that, his character actually has little relevance to the overall story and he's only related to the stopping of the necromancer. \u000a\u000a4) For a dragon that can speak impeccably with good diction, he is retarded. Could have ended the dwarfs and Bilbo in 1 second. All the protagonists are one dimensional/stupid/predictable. \u000a\u000a5) This film could have been under 1.5 hours. \u000a\u000a6) A lot of random, unnecessary scenes like the beginning of this one. Had no relation to the rest of the movie.\u000a\u000a7) it is such a cliché, the idea of good overcoming an almost impossible adversary is just so overused in this series in general, which makes it so predictable and boring.\u000a\u000aThis film is just eye candy, and even then there weren't enough Legolas/Tauriel scenes. Tauriel is really hot thou, so they have that going for them. Overall, it is really is a waste of your life. The book isn't even that great either so don't bother. \u000a\u000aLOTR is much better.

VI'm a huge fan of the first three movies and actually wished they were longer but turning "The Hobbit" into three movies, researching other Tolkien works for filler, placing LotR characters in a story when they were never there before and just making up new characters so Jackson could stretch one story into three, for me it ruined the purity of a wonderful story.\u000a\u000aPeter Jackson got to show off his special effect skills in super extension but it left me feeling like this was nothing more that a betrayal of J. R. R. Tolkien's story. I wish there was more to this movie than CGI on steroids.\u000a\u000aIt was nice seeing Evangeline Lilly on the big screen all the actors are wonderful in this brand new story but it's not "The Hobbit." I'm thinking that Jackson left the source behind in order to make more money out of the franchise. I hope someday they make one movie out of these three but I will definitely not be seeing the third.

VI am a big fan of LOTR and was looking forward to the Hobbit movies and was really excited about there being three. I didn't care if the story went askew and was fleshed out as the basic story was there. Now having just written a review of the awful UNDER THE DOME, I should point out that I am very critical of a story being dragged out just to fill a time line. However when it is done well the effort is justified. So when the first one came out and it was a wee bit of a disappointment, I was hoping it would get better in the second one and then be truly magnificent by the end of the third. The middle one is always the most difficult and so this proved. It was almost as if there was a change of directors or writers from the first as the movie was totally different from the first in tone. The first was in keeping with the book, light hearted and a pure fantasy. Now in the second part it was a more serious film with none of the songs and humour of the first. If this was the direction the director and writers wanted to go in the first place then why have all that in the first movie and none in the second? I am not a fan of the songs but I do like the humour and there is very little in this second part. If you listen to the directors commentary on the extended edition of AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY he and the writer clear up some of the "faults" with the first movie but it will take a lot of explanation as to why they discarded some of the stuff they did in the first movie for a more "serious" look and feel to the second part. I am hopeful the third and final part will wrap it all up but at the moment all I took from this second part is that they finally go to where they were heading but then again that is how the first part ended. Let's hope the third one is better….it has to be!

VOf all the Peter Jackson films, this was the one that strayed furthest from the book and in doing so, lost practically all the charm and magic of the bits I was looking forward to. Perhaps a quarter of the movie was loosely (very loosely) based on the book, the rest was unnecessarily formulaic pap (especially with the music that played each time The Ring was shown). The interaction with Beorn was reduced to about three minutes, the order of how they got lost in the woods and trapped by the spiders was changed around completely so that more fighting scenes could be put in, the dwarfs were not packed into the barrels but instead the tops were left off so that they could have yet another highly unlikely fighting scene (in real life they would have been flooded with the first waterfall) which, of course, was not in the book. The secret door was no longer a secret with a great big staircase in the form of a stone statue leading up to it, the door did not open with a piercing last sunbeam but with the light of the moon like the door of Moria. The dwarfs were not wimps hanging out by the door but engaged in full battle with Smaug in direct contradiction to anything that happened in the book. Orcs were given too much prominence. And totally unnecessary and boring love plots were introduced.\u000a\u000aAll that said, it wasn't a terrible film but in changing it so much to apparently make it more exciting, they lost most of the charm of the book. I don't think Peter Jackson's heart was in this one. I should have waited for the DVD and that says it all really.

VFor some unknown reason, I denied to watch the Lord of the Rings films for years, even though I was at the right age when they were released (which was, adolescence). I decided to watch them only last year, over 10 years later, and fell in love with how a blockbuster fantasy film series can tell so much about the real world in such a great gift wrap (that is, the visuals).\u000a\u000aSo I sat to watch the two Hobbit films this year - more accurately, yesterday, back to back. The first Hobbit film was okay, but something felt wrong. This second film came to make clear to me which parts are wrong.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, the themes of pride and the fight for it are so obviously presented - nothing like the LOTR films, where its themes were well hidden and you actually had to think a bit in order to find the underlying messages. This alone makes those two films shallow, let alone the simultaneously endless and meaningless Orc-fighting scenes which are there only to showcase the CGI technology.\u000a\u000aAnd this brings us to the second point, which is... the CGI. The original LOTR films had an organic feel, a big part of which being that all main beast characters were real people in greatly-done makeup and the backdrops actually were photographed real-life miniatures (this in particular is what I mostly loved about the visuals of those films). All these have been replaced by CGI - and not even the most "filmic" one. I have to exclude the Smaug dragon (which is exceptionally animated and rendered), but everything else feels too video-game-like. To make things worse, I noticed some terrible mistakes in lighting the actors for green screen.\u000a\u000aThird, the camera work. Peter Jackson had a discreet yet distinctive style of capturing the images of the LOTR films. The first Hobbit film was close to that, but this second film is photographed in the terrible Avatar-like way (which is, always move the camera around so that the 3D feel comes out bolder).\u000a\u000aThese are only some of the cons I got from the film. Nevertheless, as someone already said on the discussion, the film is too expensive to be terrible. It's a film you can watch as a LOTR fan or just for time killing, but it has nothing of the magic the previous films possess.

VWas apprehensive about renting this from Red Box but said what the heck, it was getting better reviews than the horrible first one so I spent, I mean wasted my $1.50 on this poor excuse of a good movie. I really don't understand what rational, sane, person over 10 years old would find this movie entertaining. Like others have said so many issues with this movie would take all day to explain them all. This movie did absolutely nothing to add debt to the characters, you still don't or even care about any of the dwarfs. The action scenes a re so unrealistic they are boring. The crappy cgi once again makes this look like a video game. The characters did very stupid things like Bill tugging on obvious spiderweb which obviously was made by large spiders. The plot is ridiculous, Gandalf is not supposed to know about Saurons return until Lotr...it's just sad what Hollywood puts out.

V"You've changed Bilbo Baggins. You're not the same hobbit as the one who left the Shire." After making it through the Misty Mountains, Bilbo (Freeman) and company must now make it through the dangerous Mirkwood Forest, this time without the help of Gandalf (Mckellen). When they arrive at the Laketown settlement Bilbo is told how to fulfill his dwarven contract. He must retrieve an artifact guarded by the deadly dragon Smaug. I will begin by saying that I was not a fan of the original Lord Of The Rings movies but did think the first Hobbit movie was good. I have just never really been of fan of the books or the movies so that will weigh into my judgment. That said I thought the last half hour of this one was exciting but up until then I found it much harder to get into then I did with the first Hobbit. I'm not sure why but historically the 2nd movie in a trilogy is usually the weakest one (Empire Strikes Back is the exception). I'm sure fans of this series will really enjoy this but I had a hard time getting into it. I am looking forward to the third one though due to the way this one ended and that I thought the Return Of The King was the best in the original trilogy. Overall, fans of the series will like this way more then I did, at least I think they will. I give this a B.

VBoyens - She wrote a movie that isn't even close to the plot of the book, and the changes were not for the better. Part of it is not her fault: she was probably told about 80% of the way through that they would change it from two movies to three. You could tell the scenes in the Mountain were blatantly added as time filler. It was seriously almost 30 minutes of Smaug chasing the Dwarfs around, and don't get me started with that illogical exploding gold statue they made. Christ, that was cringeworthy. And the Kili-Tauriel-Legolas love triangle was vomit inducing.\u000a\u000aJackson - I think he is getting too cute with his action sequences. Every kill now is some elaborate CGI-fest. When done in moderation (like the beheading of Lurtz in FOTR), it's cool. Now every orc is killed with some crazy throat-chop beheading. As a result, every "good" character now seems like an invincible killing machine, even the dwarfs who in the first movie were noted as being "merchants, minors, toymakers...not exactly the stuff of legend". The way Jackson portrays them, Legolas, Thorin, and the other 12 dwarfs could destroy all the armies of Mordor by themselves. One of these "toymakers who isn't the stuff of legend" gets turned into a barrel-tank at one point and goes two handed with some axes and slaughters about a dozen orcs in two seconds on a river bank...And then his fat ass manages to jump 10 feet across a raging river, timing his jump so that he could land perfectly inside a barrel that was about a half-inch wider than he was.\u000a\u000aI can forgive a lot of things but I was legitimately disappointed in this movie and thought the first Hobbit was much better.

VYou should never go to the cinema because you feel duty bound to see something rather than because you are really excited but that's how I felt about this one. I knew I was going to see a middle section of a story and following from the first Part of The Hobbit I knew it would be visually interesting but probably arse-achingly long.\u000a\u000aI was right about the length but the visual appeal is waning. I really liked LOTR and the visuals were stunning but we are used to that style now so the other elements of the film have to be much stronger. With this one they really stretched the story. I didn't appreciate the changes that meant that there were orcs everywhere along the journey. This simply lead to overlong, over-choreographed fight scenes where I felt I was watching a computer game.\u000a\u000aThe huge scenes in the mountain with dragon fire and falling buildings became tedious. Dwarfs were being thrown all over the place and not one was even slightly injured. Not even dwarfs would believe that covering a fire breathing dragon in molten gold would be of any use. The whole piece about molding a giant dwarvish statue was just silly.\u000a\u000aYes I will slavishly be back for part 3 because these movies need to be seen on the big screen but again it will be a sense of duty (with a huge dollop of hopefulness) not pure desire that drives me to buy a ticket.

VFor the People who have read my First hobbit review you may remember that I wasn't really positive about it and I called it a boring video game movie experience because of the CGI usage. So was this movie better?? Personally I think it is almost the same as it is very mediocre and if I have to be honest it may even be a little bit worse.\u000a\u000aThe reason why I didn't like this movie is because it felt like it was a very thin story held together with a lot of filler materials. Because of this the movie's pacing suffered and the rewards didn't pay off. Even though the first movie had boring action it at least had some scenes to develop the story. In this movie most dialogue's veld like exposition followed by action scenes plus fan service. I always wondered how Peter Jackson intended to split one book into 3 movies. Well, by extending the basic story line and adding fillers.\u000a\u000aWithout spoiling the movie I would like to say that the movie tried to follow a three act structure (beginning middle and end) but it really failed at the third act. The movie was more like a beginning and a very long middle.\u000a\u000aSome titbits Character development was decent but it wasn't really noteworthy.\u000a\u000aMusic was okay but it failed at capturing the moment when I compare it to the lord trilogy or even hobbit one. And that is because of the movies pacing.\u000a\u000aCinematography was much better than the first movie with more scenery/nature shots but there was still a lot of green screen.\u000a\u000aIn the end the movie continued the story and it is already laying down the foundations for the next trilogy. I'll give this movie a 6.

VGo to the bottom to see my overall thoughts if you want a short review of the movie.\u000a\u000aThe Desolation of Smaug looked like it would kick ass from the trailers. There was an awesome dragon, Orcs going nuts on dwarfs, and some over the top stunts. The movie was very different.\u000a\u000aThe Good:\u000a\u000a-Film maintains a constant tone: As much as I liked the first film, it had a very major problem. The film kept changing tones. At one point, we have dwarfs singing about what Bilbo hates and the next scene, we have the dwarfs explaining about the fall of their race. The Desolation of Smaug fixes this with a constant serious tone. \u000a\u000a-Great Visuals: Middle Earth once again looks fantastic with some gorgeous CGI and great shots of New Zealand. \u000a\u000a-We can take the Dwarfs more seriously: The dwarfs now have more dignity and don't have as much silly moments. That isn't to say that there are still some silly moments, but they aren't just Gimli clones now.\u000a\u000a-Smaug is AWESOME!: Though Smaug sorta looks like a generic dragon, dragons are freaking cool. Smaug is Godzilla sized which makes him even cooler. The CGI on him looks pretty good, though nothing special. Overall, I liked Smaug.\u000a\u000aThe Bad:\u000a\u000a-Movie is just one long actions scene: This is my main problem with the movie. It's just one long action scene. The stunts are pretty much the same, except that they are in different places. While the first movie had scenes of people talking drawn out way too long, this movie has action scenes drawn out way too long. They get pretty old quickly.\u000a\u000a-Not a lot of Bilbo: What I liked about the movie was being able to revisit Middle Earth again and Bilbo Baggins. In this movie, he isn't in that many scenes. The scenes he's in are usually forgettable. Instead, we focus on the dwarfs who are all interchangeable except for Thorin. By the time the movie was finished, I hardly remembered seeing Bilbo in this.\u000a\u000a-Pacing is weird: I read the books and they've paced this one really weirdly. One major event from the book takes place for only a few scenes while a minor scene from the book is stretched out for 30 minutes. It's really weird.\u000a\u000a-WAYYYY TOO LONG: This is a problem with both the hobbits. They are stretched out way too long. In the first Hobbit, it felt like we moved somewhere as Thorin finally accepted Bilbo on the quest and we learned a lot about what was going on which made up for the long time, but this movie is pretty much only action scenes. I didn't really learn anything about these people, but why have character development when we can have people jumping into crap like the 5 other scenes before it.\u000a\u000aOverall Consensus: The Desolation of Smaug had some cool stuff in it with great effects and visuals and was not a bad film. For me, this was definitely very underwhelming with one tired action scene placed after the other. Character development is little as well as the fact that the film is way too long. If you haven't read the books, you might enjoy it, but as a fan of the book, I was disappointed.

VAfter reading some of the previous reviews, I wonder what it takes to engage the modern viewer. It seems we have become so jaded that we see the necessity of giving a one star review to something as phenomenal as this film is. It is filled with action, sets of remarkable creativity, amazing characters, in a complex plot that made me long for the conclusion. I know it doesn't follow the book religiously. Get over that. Even a fifteen hour miniseries based on a novel fails miserably. Of course, every English teacher on the planet knows that we are working in two entirely different mediums. Books and movies are different! What Peter Jackson has done is taken the primary plot and allowed his script writers to take what is given and supplement it with their own creativity. The first film, though imperfect, does set the stage for this superior second effort. What we get is nonstop action, moving the characters toward the object of their quest. Tolkien's rules are followed if not the letter of the plot. The first film was criticized for being too talky. Now this one is being criticized for not being talky enough. For me, the scene where the gang must escape an elven prison and face the orcs is one of the most delightful fifteen minutes I've ever spent in a movie theater. I don't expect an action film based on a book with voluminous characters to have character development like "Driving Miss Daisy." See the film for what it is and count yourselves lucky to have the luxury of being able to see the amazing accomplishments of the Peter Jackson's of the world.

VSome have been overly gracious in their praise of this film. I will not be. I've been reading Tolkien since 1976, when I first read The Hobbit. While I did enjoy the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which Jackson got about 80 percent right, I found this, a result of the greed of the studio and Jackson and his co-writers egos, unacceptable. It was boring, overlong and had just too much filler. Tauriel is unnecessary. Read the books - no Elven women fight. This is far too much of a stretch. Then to have a love triangle between two elves and a dwarf? Unacceptable. No elf or dwarf have EVER been lovers or in love. If Tolkien didn't write it, Jackson shouldn't have included it. Adding stuff from the appendixes was a great idea, but the whole scene was done poorly. And Beorn, a major character, used in a cameo? I was disappointed beyond words in this movie. Overblown and under thought, with a horrible ending (likely because of all the unnecessary filler), this wasn't anything like the great two part film the Hobbit should have been. And, among Jackson's many crimes against The Hobbit, he totally ruined the barrel escape. Oh and Azog is dead by the time of the Hobbit. DEAD. His son, Bolg leads the Orcs of the misty mountains. I could go on, but why bother? I'm not even looking forward to the last part. And I can only imagine what the EXTENDED version of this mess will look like on DVD. Imagine is all I can do, since I'm not going to buy it.

VPeter Jacksons 'The Hobbit' trilogy is really way behind 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy in terms of quality. Firstly its being stretched out as long as 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, which is way too long for such a short book. It misses important points in the book and replaces them with over blown, drawn out action sequences. Way too much use of CGI. The sets look really fake and plastic, like a theme park. The soundtrack is uninspired as well.\u000a\u000aIdeally 'The Hobbit' would've been made as one film before the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy as a prelude to 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy.\u000a\u000aOverall, this film really lacks the magic, adventure, epicness and emotional depth of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy and I feel that Peter Jacksons uninspired and just in it for the money.

VReally feels like it was padded out so it could be a trilogy. Characters I don't recall showing up, CGI gets a little heavy handed with all the camera spinning during fights and falls, it gets to be kind of " look what we can to with the computer". This story could have been wrapped up with this film and I would have been OK with that. Now, seems like it will be more like a two-anda-third-logy, as I don't think there is much more left to the story- unless Jackson rewrites Tolkien, again. But, it kept my kid entertained for a couple of hours. Don't remember much act-ing, more like a bunch of act-ion. Didn't need the political infighting with the elves.

VThe second Hobbit movie is an improvement over the first simply because it stops for plot. There are two very long, insensibly edited, stupefyingly predictable action sequences, one toward the beginning and one at the end, but in between them there are a couple of hours of dialogue. That dialogue is mostly a string of clichés, and it has only a tangential relationship to anything J.R.R. Tolkien wrote, but at least the characters are talking instead of flinging themselves around in a glaringly artificial whirl of debris and Orc body parts. So that's the good news, if you can call it that. The bad news is that despite the opportunity to correct it, one of the main problems of the first movie is still unresolved: the Hobbit himself, Bilbo Baggins, a literary hero beloved the world over, is effectively absent from the movie that is ostensibly about him and his adventure. Tell me, what does Bilbo think about Lake Town politics, about which so many instantly-forgettable words are bandied? Who knows? We don't see or hear from him during our entire time there. Nor do we hear what he thinks about the intriguing history between the Elves of the woodland realm and Thorin's ancestors, because we are too busy watching the beardless Dwarf Kili (or, who knows, maybe it's Fili! They're all interchangeable and most don't talk!) flirt with a character that Peter Jackson invented! Bilbo, and this is a statistical fact (don't research it, just take my word for it), has less screen time than any title character since Godot. The movie is better when Bilbo is in it, which he is at the very beginning and again towards the end just before a Scooby Doo chase scene starts between Smaug and the Dwarv\u0435s. But as appealing as the intrepid Hobbit is in his fleeting cameos, before you can say "second breakfast" Jackson's rickety roller coaster is off again and Bilbo's out of sight. Maybe in the three-hour final movie Jackson will somehow find time to squeeze Bilbo in, either during the action of the Battle of Five Armies or, if the film can accommodate such luxuries in such a short runtime, during moments of dialogue. For a refresher on how to achieve this sort of thing, Jackson should refer to his own beautiful and character-rich adaptations of the Lord of the Rings.

VAnd not in a positive way.\u000a\u000aThis movie is another good example for Peter Jackon's flawed style of film making.\u000a\u000aWhen I was 17, the Fellowship was released and I was blown away. Not by the storytelling or the portrayal of the characters. No, it was the amazingly detailed illustration of Tolkien's world that got me hooked. I loved the books and already felt that some things in the way the characters were presented were off, but I didn't care because of the spectacle. I watched it three times in cinema alone and was totally hyped when the trailer for the Two Towers was released.\u000a\u000aI went to the cinema with great expectations and I disliked the movie almost completely. Too many Hollywood clichés and more noise than substance or heart made this one already a big let down, as well as Jackson's disability to be subtle and remain meaningful. Add to that many scenes that are involuntarily funny, and you arrive at almost B movie quality plot devices.\u000a\u000aThe Return of the King continued in the same way, while leaving out some great scenes from the book and having quite a few questionable (and laughable) stylistic decisions (Lighthouse Sauron, the ghost army for example). Add to that the very anti-climatic solutions to the great battles and some really atrocious changes to the books characters (again) and I was left with an empty feeling to what I first thought could be an enjoyable movie going experience.\u000a\u000aSo, when it was said that some other director than Jackson would be responsible for the adaptation of The Hobbit, I must have been one of the few, who was a actually glad about this bit of news.\u000a\u000aAnd then Jackson got in again and in addition to his already annoying direction goes all Lucas with The Hobbit.\u000a\u000aAnd this time I just hate it. My main problems among many are:\u000a\u000a1. Catering to lowest denominator: Cram in more action, more romance and childish humour and people will love it. 2. CGI Overuse: Much like Lucas' Star Wars prequels, this prequel trilogy is marked by an overuse of CGI. And it completely takes me out of the movie. While the first trilogy (especially FotR) made a sensible use of its SFX budget, Jackson now has apparently way to much money to spend on CGI sequences. Maybe I've become too sensitive in that respect, but I get sick when I see CG orcs doing conversation. Especially Azog looks so out of place, I can't imagine any reason why they decided against using masks and costumes. Especially when it worked so well in LotR. 3. Trying to be like LotR: The Hobbit is a completely different tale than The Lord of the Rings, but Jackson tries to make it as epic and meaningful and it just doesn't work for me. It also distracts heavily from the original story and its main character. More so than in AuJ, Bilbo as character and main protagonist is completely underused and subdued. Now, you would expect that time saved here is used to make the other characters more interesting and memorable. And indeed, with the amount of time Jackson reserved for the adaption, there should have been plenty of time, to give the dwarfs some character and actually improve on the book, where the dwarfs remain quite bland. Unfortunately, it's not better than in the novel. 4. Way too much over the top action: Combined with the CGI, this absolutely shattered my suspension of disbelief. There's no feel of tension or danger. Combine that with the problem that I don't care for the characters and all I get is big yawn from the prolonged fight scenes. 5. Copying from the Lord of the Rings: This trilogy doesn't bring in any new ideas. Kingsfoil, the way the Ring slips on Bilbo's finger, a Worm Tongue look a like... it's just so obvious.\u000a\u000aAnother thing that bugged me is that Jackson has to show us how evil the ring is with Bilbo as an example. Now, some people actually think that the scene in question is one of the best from the movie, but it just doesn't make sense in the long run. If the ring gets a hold on Bilbo this early, shouldn't Bilbo have changed drastically by the time his 111th birthday arrives? And it's not because Gandalf reminds him that killing is bad, that he doesn't take Gollum's life. It's because of his peaceful Hobbit nature (Murder is basically unheard of in the shire). All this makes Bilbo/Frodo so resilient against the influence of the ring. Now it just doesn't fit in the context anymore.\u000a\u000aI could go on and on, there is so much that is off, but the typical moviegoer with his craving for action and show wont notice anyway.\u000a\u000aThe truth is, that these movies have become boring and stale. Sometimes less is more. A good story, told with heart and soul is much more compelling than this CGI extravaganza, hailed by the people who are satisfied with seeing Middle Earth on the big screen again. But sorry Peter, that alone wont make a good movie. At least not in my book.

VEasily a contender for one of the worst blockbusters of the decade, The Desolation of Smaug crushes everything good about the beloved story The Hobbit and bakes in every stale trope of modern action movies. The bitterest part is how obviously this script was drawn out to fill up three films, when it could have been a more intimate work, just as the novel had been. \u000a\u000aToo many other elements have been forced into the story, attempting to create conflict where none need exist. The worst of this is the love triangle between Legolas, Kili and a character, Tauriel, who was invented precisely for this purpose, making the movie read more like a soap-opera than an epic fantasy. The barrel ride, for example, was made into some complicated Rube Goldberg plot device to arrive at a romantic climax later in Laketown. For purists, the characterizations are all off, with Bard as a fisherman scorned by the townsfolk, an all-too-prominent Radagast sketched as an addled hobo, and the Laketown mayor far too paranoid about some imaginary revolution on the edge of erupting. The dragon, who was to have been the pièce de résistance, gets mired in an action sequence that takes all the gas out of the character, and the tête à tête between Bilbo and Smaug is devoid of the mischievous streak in our hobbit hero that made the book version so entertaining.\u000a\u000aThe movie had a weird light to it, and left me wondering if I was watching some PBS video drama from the 70s or 80s. Most of the movie lacked the natural light that made the Lord of the Rings so breathtaking in its sweep. In that series, the beauty of New Zealand really shone through, but this series has an artificial quality to it, reminiscent of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. The action sequences were cartoonish and over-the-top, suspending the laws of physics in a brazen manner, creating an almost campy tone. Directorially, the actors seemed to be struggling with dialogue that felt out of place in the story (though that could just be my bias for the original).\u000a\u000aThis movie seemed to have all the elements of a success: a well-established franchise, the founding director, an ensemble of great actors and stunning VFX technology, but the script was far too crowded and the action too muddy to entertain. I want to say the producers filled the movie to overflowing as an apology for poor script choice, but then I remind myself that the overflowing was the problem in the first place.

VUgh. This movie is painful to watch from beginning to end. First there is the atrocious editing. The beginning of the movie is simply difficult to follow. Then there is the fact that the plot unravels fairly quickly. Orcs are relentlessly pursuing the party for what reason exactly? Oh right, it's to give Orlando Bloom and elf-girl a reason to be in the movie. Gandalf's cut-away scenes make no sense. The scenes in the forest are just plain ridiculous. The final scene with Smaug is similarly ludicrous, poorly written, and overly dependent on CGI. Smaug the terrible comes across as pretty inept at killing for a creature that purportedly wiped out an entire army of hard ass, armored dwarfs and a city of humans.\u000a\u000aThere are a few places where the movie rolls well. The fighting on the barrels is very well done and the scenes with Bard and the town kingpin mesh well.\u000a\u000aBut ultimately the movie is ruined by too many big names demanding close-ups and screen time. It would have been better to sharply cut back on both Gandalf's and Legolas' appearances or at least connect them back to the central plot more cleverly.

VWhen The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey premiered on silver screen as the first in a trilogy of films based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, the response it received was mostly positive to mixed. The majority of criticism was targeted at the needless expansion of a single film story into three features but, in my opinion, it did commence this latest Middle-Earth adventure on the right note and, despite its sluggish pace, ended up providing a largely satisfying experience.\u000a\u000aThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the second chapter of The Hobbit film series & picks the story right from where it was left off in An Unexpected Journey. Continuing the adventures of Bilbo Baggins who's accompanying thirteen dwarfs on their quest to reclaim the kingdom of Erebor, the film covers the journey ahead for these fellows which is full of dangers and even if they manage to get away with it & reach the Lonely Mountain safely, they have a stupendous dragon to deal with.\u000a\u000aOne thing I have always admired about this Middle-Earth franchise is the filmmaker's strong intent to keep the story very much within the realms of Tolkien's spirit. But this latest chapter marks a significant departure from such faithfulness & ends up being an immensely frustrating experience. There are a few things The Desolation of Smaug gets right but there are also way too many things that are wrong with it. Let's start with the things it gets right first.\u000a\u000aSince the previous chapter was criticized for its sluggish pace, the filmmakers have vastly improved the pacing in this middle chapter with addition of many more action sequences to keep the entertainment going throughout its runtime. Production design continues to amaze. Cinematography encapsulates the picture with a darker layer which suits its tone. Visual effects has its share of highs n lows & Howard Shore's score is good but it also stumbles a little for the very first time.\u000a\u000aNow coming to what's wrong with it... First, it slaughters the book in a manner that's plainly insulting to Tolkien. Second, the absurdly introduced love triangle, overindulgence of Elves & eye-rollingly cheesy dialogues are poor filler substitutes. Third, this film had a great opportunity to further develop its characters but thanks to its rushed pace & more emphasis on over-the-top action over a riveting narration, we still have difficulty in recalling the correct names of all the Dwarfs.\u000a\u000aAnd that's not all. Martin Freeman is brilliant as Bilbo Baggins but his character is demoted into a secondary role for the centre stage is taken by Richard Armitage's Thorin. The remaining Dwarfs get only as much screen time as they did in the last chapter. Elves have never been as annoying as they are in this film for Legolas wasn't even needed in this adventure & Tauriel, who doesn't even exist in the novel but was created to bring a feminine energy to the series, is given a stupid love story to work with instead.\u000a\u000aAt last, I would like to talk about Smaug. Exquisitely designed, remarkably portrayed & meticulously detailed, this splendid beast of CGI is a jaw-dropping wonder to look at & the painstaking work that went into bringing this magnificent dragon to life truly deserves a bow. But thanks to its inefficient handling by the filmmakers, the cunning, proud & intelligent dragon of the novel is turned into a foolish creature here which is a shame because Smaug could've been as memorable to this trilogy as Gollum was to The Lord of the Rings.\u000a\u000aOn an overall scale, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an emotionally unappealing but visually spectacular sequel which features a much more exciting, fiercely paced & action-packed entertainment that'll satisfy most filmgoers but for the devoted fans of Middle-Earth, it's a heartbreaking disappointment that adds even more insult to injury by abruptly ending at one of the most frustrating cliffhangers in cinema history, thus leaving the experience very much incomplete in the end.

VAs The Two Towers is my favorite film of the previous trilogy and I was told The Desolation of Smaug was darker than the first Hobbit film, I was looking forward to this one. But my god, was it disappointing. Why? Well, here's why:\u000a\u000a- Gandalf and Bilbo have to be the most important ánd most interesting characters of this trilogy. But where are they in this film? Gandalf leaves the group pretty early in the film and we hardly see him again. And also Bilbo isn't really used to his maximum capability, it almost looks like Peter Jackson forgot the film has Bilbo.\u000a\u000a- So, who gets all the screen time, then? Well, there is this dwarf that gets his leg hurt and an elf who randomly falls in love with him and wants to heal him. And then there is Legolas, who also loves this elf or something? This love triangle is apparently so interesting that during the big scene with Bilbo and Smaug, they keep cutting back to the dwarf and his leg that hurts. Yeah, I really didn't wanna miss that.\u000a\u000a- And this film is filled with a lot of boring and pretty much useless characters and appearances. Boring characters such as that leader of the elves. And useless appearances like Cate Blanchett showing up for 2 seconds. Or that Radagast dude, who only appears so he can lift his hat and show there is a birds nest underneath. Exciting AND useful.\u000a\u000a- Anyway, you can really tell that Hobbit 2 is mostly filler- material. I guess you can just walk in the film during the third act and you wouldn't have missed any essential part of the story. I'm even assuming you can just skip the entire film and go right to There And Back Again and you wouldn't be all that confused with what you've missed. \u000a\u000a- Also, I find it frustrating that Jackson didn't even take the time to give this movie a proper ending. Fellowship, Two Towers and even Hobbit 1 had cliffhangers too, but at least they felt like they had an ending. Here the film just stops in the middle of a scene, like it's a cliffhanger for an episode of a TV-show. Only difference is; this is a three hour movie! A little more effort wouldn't be too much to ask, right? I mean, the man who had 20 endings for Return of the King didn't have one left for this film and so he just simply cuts to black?\u000a\u000a- The one thing I would look forward to with this film, was the dark tone. I thought the first Hobbit was a little too childish, with all these trolls and goblins with funny voices. But Peter Jackson apparently liked this, so he even gave the giant spiders a voice. Yeah, that just what Shelob, one of the scariest and most awesome creatures from the original trilogy, needed; a funny voice. Only cool thing I can say about that is, is that one of the voices was done by Peter Verne- Jones (Lord Crumb in Bad Taste). But still, why would you give those spiders a voice?\u000a\u000a- I guess the voice of Smaug seemed a little more appropriate. Benedict Cumberbatch does a pretty decent job on the voice of the dragon, really dark and mysterious. Only problem is.. the dragon just won't shut up. I guess this scene had to be stretched to reach the 3 hour mark, but my God, couldn't the dragon just shut up for one minute? He really got a lot less mysterious and threatening when he just kept talking and talking. Too bad.\u000a\u000a- So, is that all the problems I had with The Hobbit 2? Not really, there were still two things that really annoyed me. First of all, there were these horrible scenes in this little town, with Stephen Fry as the mayor/leader/master- guy. It looked like an unfunny episode of Blackadder, did they really except us to take this stuff serious? Stephen Fry was totally inappropriate and out of place, his Wormtongue- ripoff- sidekick was really annoying (the guy obviously isn't a Brad Dourif) and that Bard and his family were far from interesting characters. And still, we stay in that town for a very, very long time. \u000a\u000a- Last thing I really hated was the 3D- HFR. I saw the film in HFR and I can't remember ever seeing something so incredible ugly. I really can't believe someone actually chooses his film to look like that. And they say that's the future for cinema? God, I hope not!\u000a\u000aLast but not least, is there anything positive to say about The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug? Yes, there is. Like with the previous film (and also the first trilogy), the effects look great and the action sequences are well put together. And Martin Freeman is a great leading man, much better than Elijah Wood for the Lord of the Rings films. But still, Freeman doesn't get to do a lot, because of all the other uninteresting characters showing their faces. \u000a\u000aBest scene of the movie? That is, without a doubt, Gandalf showing up at Dol Guldur and seeing the return of Sauron (with that Mordor- theme playing). That gave me some chills, as a true Lord of the Rings fan. But it was only for a short while, because right after Gandalf vs Sauron, we had to return to dwarfs with leg pains, elves in love and Stephen Fry.

VThe problem with the LotR trilogy was the sheer size of the opus. There was so much material that a lot would have to be left out in order to streamline the movie and make it work. Usually it tends to work and it did in that context. Here, however, the book is considerably shorter and one would think it would be easier to adapt to a movie. \u000a\u000aThe original plan was to make two movies, correspondingly to the structure of the book. Now with the second movie the bad story telling decisions made early at the scripting phase are beginning to snowball out of control. There's just so much bloat and unnecessary alterations without which a much more compact and to-the-point end result could have been achieved. Not much is left to expect from the third movie anymore. Maybe somebody could do a fan edit after the third movie is released.\u000a\u000aThe brilliance of Tolkien's work is in the fact that he wrote what he wanted the way he wanted to. The error here is trying to force the story to a mold it originally refused to fit into. It makes not sense. The original story captivated millions of people. Why could a true to the original adaptation not do it?

VI enjoyed some of Desolation of Smaug but not as much as the first instalment. If you've not seen it yet ignore the comments below, there be dragons...I mean spoilers there.\u000a\u000aThe bits I did like Peter Jackson cameo in the opening shot Bilbo at the top of the forest, beautiful and stunning.\u000a\u000aLikewise when they saw the city on the side of the mountain for the first time.\u000a\u000aThe Spider battle and the fact the spiders spoke like Gollum/Smeagol The Barrels scene (My second favourite bit in the book after Bilbo playing riddles with Gollum) The halls full of gold (again stunning effects) and Bilbo's encounter with Smaug.\u000a\u000aSeeing Gandalf actually use some magic for a change and engage in a magic battle.\u000a\u000aThe tomb of the Nine and how they made you think differently about the Eye of Sauron.\u000a\u000aLegolas being god dam kick-ass! \u000a\u000aWhat I didn't like: \u000a\u000aThe love triangle that sprang up from no-where and made no sense between the dwarf and the Elf lady.\u000a\u000aEndless supply of Orc fodder.\u000a\u000aThe lack of any real threat because not a single good guy has died yet.\u000a\u000aToo many dramatic poses and overacting, especially by Thorin 'Strike a Pose' Oakenshield.\u000a\u000aDo we really need emotional, powerful music in every single scene, even when people are just talking? Rhadaghast the Brown just having a cameo and doing sod all.\u000a\u000aBilbo being congratulated on his keen eyesight because he's spotted a giant carving of a Dwarf in the side of the mountain, how amazing must his eyes be??! The dwarfs spending months journeying to the mountain, only to give up after 5 minutes.\u000a\u000aThe sub-plot between the dwarfs, the Bard and the Master in that town. None of it worked apart from the comedy value of the dwarfs being covered in fish and then sneaking into the house via the toilet.\u000a\u000aI found it ludicrous that they made such a fuss about 'getting across the lake' and into the town, why didn't they just walk down the pier like the Orcs did? The whole over the top running 'battle' between the dwarfs and Smaug inside the mountain. I mean what was all that about? It was such an elaborate digital laden farce which ended in the most ludicrous of ways.\u000a\u000aThe ending. I mean it's been thrown in our faces that Smaug has a scale missing, only a black arrow can pierce it and the Bard has one arrow left. What could possibly happen when Smaug attacks the town? Maybe I'm wrong but it's hardly a cliffhanger isn't it? I think for me overall the reason I didn't like it as much was the first one focused on Bilbo and told the tale from his perspective for the most part. This one Bilbo's not really central and it's all over the place. That combined with so much CGI, some stunning, some obvious, made me feel detached during the last hour or so.

VHaving seen both of the Hobbit films, I must say I have found them a big disappointment. I have read the Hobbit many times – as a teacher it was often my class novel to 10/11 year old children, who grew to love Bilbo as much as I did. I looked forward to the films and while all the costumes, special effects, battle scenes, etc are excellent, for me it is not the same as Tolkein's novel. There is a lot of emphasis on battle scenes with the Orcs and Goblins, who must be said as fearsome as they look, are pretty rubbish with swords and bows and arrows! The charm of the book for me is the central character, Bilbo Baggins, who finds himself taken out of his natural environment in Bag End, on an adventure he does not want to be on, and wishes many times to be back in his own little hobbit hole. From my viewpoint this charm is missing in the film. The story too I feel has been spoilt by dragging it out for 3 parts – I had difficulty keeping my eyes open for the beginning of the first film, where 'The Unexpected Party' dragged on far too long that it actually became boring. I can appreciate that the film is an adaptation of Tolkein's work, but for me the book remains supreme!

VWhen Guillermo del Toro was out of The Hobbit and Peter Jackson was back in, I was a bit disappointed to say the least. Guillermo is a fantastic visual artist if nothing else and would probably have given us something beautiful and unexpected. Well at least PJ has done this before - I thought - and if he can avoid repeating the things I felt least satisfying from The lord of the rings movies (cringeworthy action sequences aimed for 15 years old boys to put in the trailer and painfully dragged out camera roller coasters in caves or landscapes where nothing of interest to the story happens) this would be an OK representation of The Hobbit.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately since there really isn't story enough in The Hobbit for three whole movies of this magnitude, PJ had to fill them with a lot of fluff (yes you guessed it - cringeworthy action sequences aimed for 15 years old boys to put in the trailer and painfully dragged out camera roller coasters in caves or landscapes where nothing of interest to the story happens). And instead of actually elaborating on the scenes that occur in the book he prefers to cut most of these as short as possible to fit totally irrelevant junk in there. Also there is a significant mood change from the book in order to make The Hobbit more into a Lord of the rings duplicate.\u000a\u000aThe second installment in The Hobbit trilogy gives you pretty much the same of what was started in the first movie, only more so. There is less of events from the actual book and more of irrelevant side stories this time around. Total lack of character development during the film and the main character Bilbo is basically just a parenthesis throughout. It feels very much like a regular studio production to make money instead of any attempt to make a work of art.\u000a\u000aThis isn't really worth going to the cinemas for and it has left me totally indifferent for the final movie.\u000a\u000a:) Best part of the movie: Well made props and some beautiful sets.\u000a\u000a:( Worst part of the movie: It has few relations to the actual book. Big waste of opportunity.

VBy far the worst , until now of the series. Bad script, bad acting, bad cgi,.... 13 dwarfs and a hobbit are on a journey, enter the elven forest and not for long they are discovered by the elves....but an whole army of cgi orcs are not, they can advance,surprising elf sentries!!!!! Bilbo is back as the fifth(fourteenth) wheel. As ever disliked by Thorin. Where is the friendship gone that was there at the end of the first Hobbit journey. The orc mercenary Bolg walks around as if he just crapped his pants.(Way to cgi)It's all just to visible. Makes the film look cheap. Like the barrel ride downstream. Legolas was older here then in the LOTR films .Serious!!! The dragon was to easily fooled by fellowship of the midgets(It is after all a children's book)Is this the reason why we get a dumb dragon? Morgul tips(blade for Frodo, arrow for Kili) have jet to become as lethal as in the first LOTR film. I was amazed by the sheer number of orcs killed by elves,dwarfs and a hobbit.I was afraid there weren't going to be enough left for the announced war. Was it all bad. No, the ring making you Dr Dolitlle was fun. The bear creature was fun in an awkward way. The becoming of the lidless eye was kind of great. The dragon was fantastic even portrayed stupid. The dialog between Smaug and Bilbo was great. Ian the Grey was good as ever and managed to carry the overlong scene at Dol Guldur. The be-headings were a funny addition, however useless they seemed.

VMr. Peter Jackson\ufeff , why would you do this to the second movie? It is such a filler that I was almost sure that I'm watching something which is not from the Tolkien universe. As a lifelong fan of these books I have been awaiting every adaptation with huge anticipation. And with The lord of the rings you did such a perfect artwork, that the whole world was (and still is) at your feet. It is a true reconstruction of the whole tale. And even with the first Hobbit film you did a good, inspiring fantasy epic. But everything that you did right with the trilogy and the first Hobbit movie, you did wrong with the second one. I cannot imagine how I would've felt if there wasn't the scene between Smaug and Bilbo. The whole movie would have been pointless if it was bas as well. At least that scene was deserving. Of course that doesn't change the fact that you made up 2/3 of the story and characters from The Desolation of Smaug. Scenes, characters, relations - all out of space and sense. And why? Because the big bosses from the studios implied that they want more movies and money. Because cinema is a tool which can be perverted. But you can't do that to Sir Tolkien's imagination! His works are beyond time, beyond people or wealth. So that is why I would like to ask of you, Mr. Peter Jackson - please do the third one right (you have the materials). If not to us, the fans, you owe it to Tolkien's legacy.

VSuch a disappointment. Only 10% of the movie was The Hobbit. Every scene changed. Every character-building moment of Bilbo changed. Missing all of the charm and humor of the book. I rated it higher than I should because if you never read the book it's not a bad movie. If you wanted to add the extra Necromancer story, fine. But why not preserve the original story of The Hobbit? Anyone who loved the book will find this a real let down. Good points -- the fight with Gandalf and the Necromancer and the dragon scenes (however inaccurate). Better than the first installment. The movie was a little dull in places--forced foreshadowing in the dialogue took away some of the mystery. Overall: if you loved the book you probably should wait for the DVD. If you never read the book, this is a fun adventure story that should have been given a different name.

VI was very surprised to learn that The Hobbit would be a trilogy. This second installment makes it clear that Jackson did not have enough content from the book for great screen writing across 3 films, so expect a lot of cheesy, brain-dead fluff throughout this movie. I was pretty disappointed.\u000a\u000aParts of the movie are downright boring because they don't add anything to the story. The scene where the master of the lake town is getting out of bed scratching his butt and emptying his chamber pot? Totally unnecessary! Likewise, most of the dialogue from the people of lake town was not necessary. I didn't appreciate the liberties taken with the writing.\u000a\u000aThe cinematography from LotR was beautiful, stunning... and with the 3D for the Hobbit, the cinematography just doesn't live up. The 3D is best during action scenes and I would agree enhances the action some, but during all other parts of the movie with rolling, scenic hills or intimate dialogue between characters, the 3D filming brings the film down. I am not sure if this is because they need to use different angles, lenses and setups to make the 3D work, but something is way off. Sometimes I felt like I was watching a bad history channel movie.\u000a\u000aSometimes it looks extremely real, but at the same time, extremely fake. Most of the time it just looks fake. I could not get over the feeling that I was watching actors in a studio or on set with fake lighting. The 3D kind of ruined the film's ability to pull in a viewer into a fantasy world the way the LotR movies did.\u000a\u000aI will not watch this movie again and I think Jackson missed the opportunity to make a great movie with The Hobbit. I would never have compared the original LotR movies to something you would see on a made-for-TV-movie.

VSo here's the main points.\u000a\u000a1. The actor who plays Thorin did a video commercial for the DVD of the movie that you just paid to see in the theater suggesting that you should pay more now so that you could get some wondervision DVD at some later date when it becomes available. It looked eerily similar to those videos of terrorist hostages talking about how America blows. Nice job Hollywood.\u000a\u000a2. Like the first installment of this three movie one book epic there are action scenes of infinite length that, basically, are set up so that the dudes that make the Lego video game of the Hobbit don't have to think too much.\u000a\u000a3. Speaking of action scenes, in the "barrel ride" scene something really weird happened in my theater. I think the projectionist kept mixing in video of his family's white water rafting trip from last summer. Either that, or they just forgot to bring a film camera the day they shot the close ups of frothy water. Maybe Peter Jackson made a selfie movie on his cellphone of him splashing around in his bathtub and stuck it in thinking no one would notice.\u000a\u000a4. The studio or whatever must have finally gotten the note that they forgot to put any black people in Middle Earth because they put one whole black person in this one. Sure it was just one extra in a Lake Town scene, but at least they kept cutting back to reaction shots of her face for awkwardly long and obvious takes. Now no one can say that Middle Earth isn't racially diverse.\u000a\u000a5. They could have given an actual speaking role to a black person. Like Bart. I don't think Tolkien ever said one way or another if Bart was white or not. Instead, they appeared to give Bart's role to Jean Claude van Damme made to look youthful through the magic of CG. \u000a\u000aIncidentally, Jean Claude van Damme once told me that he could kick me in the eyeball without getting up from his seat across the dinner table after I told him that I really liked his performance in Monaco Forever. Nice to see you again Jean Claude!\u000a\u000aIt's not the worst movie ever made intended to help stretch a single, fairly lightweight fantasy book into three seven hour movies but it's not the best either.

VFirstly, I loved Tolkien's books (especially the Hobbit) and was absolutely enchanted with Peter Jacksons film versions of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In fact, those are some of my favorite memories of my adolescence. My Dad coming home with our first DVD player and picking a movie to buy with it (and of course he chose "The Fellowship of the Ring"). I was twelve years old. After seeing the FOTR, I went and read the Hobbit and all of The Lord of the Rings books before the Two Towers film had come out. It was a magical experience. It was all so real to me; even at twelve years old, I somehow had this wonderful hope and belief that Tolkien's world was real, and that he hadn't simply made it all up; that maybe it was just a world that had come long before our time. I even spent my free time making bows in the forests surrounding my home, trying to pause the movie to observe the designs on Legolas' bow, and borrowing "The Bowyer's Bible" from an old friend who was also a bow and LOTR enthusiast. Those who knew me in those days remember my bows could shoot over the tallest pine trees in Sam Houston National Forest, which were quite tall.\u000a\u000aAnyways… the reality is that when the Lord of the Rings films were first being made, Peter Jackson was almost a nobody, and Tolkien was definitely a somebody (relatively speaking). Tolkien was a master story teller, a pioneer in literature, and in many ways a founding author of the fantasy genre. That said, during the making of the Lord of the Rings, Jackson was much more humble and allowed the passionate Tolkien artists and craftsmen to pour their work out (To include staying true to much of Tolkien's source material, and when deviation was necessary, staying true to the spirit of the work). From my observations, I have concluded that the Lord of the Rings film was a masterpiece 10% because of Peter Jackson's directing and adapting and 90% because of the artists, craftsmen, and actors who loved Tolkien's work and poured themselves into recreating it, and of course making minor deviations as necessary for the sake of turning the story from one medium to another (book to film), while staying true to the spirit of the books. During the making of the film, I think that Peter Jackson mostly gave people thumbs up as they poured out their amazing work, but in the end, he got the majority of credit for the masterpiece, physically carrying many of the Oscars and the publicity with it. That's not to say he doesn't deserve his due credit for the logistics, preparation, directing and adaptation of the project (hence the 10%).\u000a\u000aSo then life went on. Pretty much everyone believed Jackson was a truly great artist and story teller. Jackson had done what was thought for a long time to be impossible. He had brought the Lord of the Rings books to film, and it was done in a masterful way.\u000a\u000aAnd then we saw King Kong, and then we saw District 9 (Both over-rated and highly forgettable films in my humble opinion)and now we're seeing the Hobbit series… I'm Afraid the Hobbit is something like %60 Peter Jackson, and only %40 the master artists, craftsmen, and actors that made the original Lord of the Rings films so great. Many of these wonderful people are still present, but they've been pushed into the background to make way for the overconfident director of the Lord of the Rings, who mistakenly decided he was the most qualified to make the most important artistic contributions to the film.\u000a\u000aNow we have a film made primarily by Peter Jackson and it is like almost all of his other films (save LOTR): silly, unbelievable, and at best cinema fodder for less appreciative movie goers. I will not tell you what the Hobbit films are (All the other reviews can do that for you), but I will tell you what The Hobbit films are not. They are not the masterpieces made primarily by the Tolkien enthusiasts and great artists that we saw a decade ago. This is Peter Jackson's film, and everyone else, including Tolkien, has been pushed to the sideline.\u000a\u000aFour stars instead of one, because the contributions from the great artists and enthusiasts are still quite noticeable.

VComing in to the movie I didn't know what to expect, after the first one which was a bit disappointing. The story was great,( I have not read the book). Leaving on a cliffhanger was what I expected to happen, Cumberbatch's voice was great, Martin Freeman did a great job again, Gandalf choosing to leave the dwarfs was stupid, but getting Sauron into this movie was expected. Legolas looks older than in the LOTR series. All in all the movie was much better than the first one. Good job Jackson, get the third one rolling. Make it better than the first one, and I'll be happy.\u000a\u000aP.S people will ship Bilbo and Smaug after this one.

VI have never wanted to like a movie as much as The Desolation of Smaug. I even said a private prayer that I would live long enough to see the completion of the trilogy. That being said, this just doesn't match up with the other films in this series. Yes, there are epic landscapes. Yes, the CGI is amazing. Yes, the portrayal of Smaug is magnificent (and the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch is awesome). However, there are so many issues with this film.... Lets start with the introduction of a character that is never in the movie...WTF? Then, build a love triangle on top of it that is also not part of the story line. As much as I like looking at Evangeline Lilly, her character "Tauriel" is an insertion into the movie that allows Peter Jackson to extend the story line and justification for stretching this 1 book into 3 movies. Tolkien is sacred in my house, as his stories have now enthralled 3 generations of children in my family. Passed down from my father to me, and me to my son. It was the first full novel of any literary significance that I ever read. As it was for my son. The story is marvelous, rich, and deep. The characters are well developed and immortal. So, I guess what I am saying is, when a director and studio feel the need to insert characters and story lines into something that is so treasured and revered, it cheapens the entirety of the film to a degree. This isn't the first time that Jackson has taken creative leniency in the films...But this is the first time that "creative leniency" cannot be applied as a term. This is borderline blasphemous. After the introduction of Tauriel, I had a hard time lending credence to the 20 minutes or so of "crafted" story line developed around her introduction. It was obvious filler, and the rest of the movie crawled along until I found myself souring on the whole experience. Perhaps I am over thinking the whole thing, but this movie just seemed "off" for me. It seemed contrived and generic, and it felt like it was being fed to me. My worst fear is that the continuation of this unauthentic side story will permeate into the last film, and ruin what should be an epic conclusion to the book.

VWhat just happened here? Let me take this slow (hand over head)... \u000a\u000aWhen did a Peter Jackson work of visual art (a la Kandinsky) turn into under stylized , ham handed dotard of a movie with incredibly poor CGI (you can actually see rendering faults on screen along with jerky puppet-like movements).\u000a\u000aSince when did Peter Jackson rip the soul from a story and make a genocidal dragon seem completely... incompetent? \u000a\u000aThe worst Peter Jackson movie, ever. He should have stuck with JRR's book version rather than infuse it with his own (lame) ideas! Not sure who's responsible though, with legendary feuding between the Studio & Jackson, Del Toro & Jackson, years of delays and multiple script rewrites. If you nurture something with love, it shows. If you don't, you get the Hobbit 2, The desolation of The Hobbit (the book).

VI'll keep this brief.\u000a\u000aWhy is it only 5/10. Smaug is fantastic after all. The effects superb. Cinematography, direction etc. Yep all great. A little serious at times, so Martin Freeman does well to add some light relief.\u000a\u000aBut the reason why this cannot score over 5/10 is the utter pointlessness of the film. The Hobbit is a lovely children's book, one of my favorites and should have only been one film, maximum two. I'm afraid it is a money-making, selling-out exercise of which you are being laughed at. I was infuriated when I saw Smaug fly off to Lake Town and the film just ended- bloody finish it!!!! If Peter Jackson knew what that it was to be carved into three films would he have agreed? Not impressed.

VApologies for the facetious summary but this movie unfortunately does deserve it. Note that I will let you know when the spoilers begin. Of course, I really can't spoil anything for you. The movie will spoil your day, all on its own.\u000a\u000aA low score warrants context. My daughter, 13, and I, 42, loved the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and forgave The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey as an acceptable though uninspired start to the trilogy in progress. Prior to watching this, I'd read numerous reviews claiming that the second Hobbit installment was much, much better than the first, and that Smaug was the best on-screen dragon of all time. Finally, I love the books, but this poor review is not a result of Jackson's "faithless" adaptation.\u000a\u000aThe Lord of the Rings has great character development, palpable relationships, and surfaces inner struggles very effectively. The Hobbit limps along, relying mainly on the characters we got to know in LotR (the few that are in the movie), and preventing any real interaction with the "new characters" through a never-ending montage of frenzied activity. Jackson gave himself 3 movies to help us connect with The Hobbit, and I sadly feel confident that installment 3 will come and go and I'll feel totally disconnected to the characters in this trilogy, and even worse, it may damage my feelings for the LotR Trilogy.\u000a\u000aA LIST OF SPOILERS: 1. Smaug is introduced brilliantly. What follows however, is utter disappointment. Bilbo, lacking any discretion as he eyes the Arkenstone. Is this realistic behavior? A bunch of fat dwarfs tricking Smaug in his own lair. Really? This is where the book got it right. It was just Bilbo and Smaug, and Smaug could not see Bilbo, who was wearing the ring. And even invisible, Bilbo was petrified. Such is the fear that Smaug should invoke; fear that Jackson fails to stir. 2. Legolas and other characters have gone from near-impossible feats in the LotR to non-stop suspensions of reality. Is this the Matrix, where the laws of physics can be ignored? This may sound hypercritical, but constantly defying the laws of physics reduces the movie to a video game with human characters, rather than a film that is cleverly using CGI. The lack of reality is ongoing and overbearing. 3. So, the party gets to the Lonely Mountain, and presumably the entrance, in which a keyhole will be revealed at last light. Well, the sun sets, and there's no keyhole, and the dwarfs, after mere seconds, give up and begin to descend the mountain. Really? Just like that? Aren't they accustomed to obscure riddles/instructions by now? My message to Jackson is this: whether being faithful to the book or not, be faithful to the characters' motives and context, and you'd actually make the audience care.\u000a\u000aI'll stop momentarily, because I want to actually enjoy my day, and reliving this very mediocre movie is not going to help. I hope that Jackson's obsession with CGI and other technological cinematic advances diminishes, so he can once again make movies with real characters, and memorable dialogue.\u000a\u000aThe LotR Trilogy is on a shelf in our home, and I can safely say The Hobbit Trilogy will never find its way on that shelf, or any other.

VFirst off, this movie can barely be called "The Hobbit." It is very loosely based on the book, and insignificant things are made into huge arcs of the story. I wont go into spoilers, but suffice to say, the second-third of the book is all out of order and great liberties are taken with plot and character development. The plot they do add is full of holes and inconsistencies. It is sad that they didn't trust the book on its own merit enough to give it any respect, filling it with endless fight scenes and way too much comedic relief.\u000a\u000aSecondly, Peter Jackson "Jacksoned up" this movie even more than his previous works. Unnecessary, so-downright-ludicrous-that-it-is-not- even-funny things are added, like Legolas surfing on everything in existence, a dwarf becoming an unstoppable killing machine by wearing a barrel, attempting to burn a dragon with something heated with its own breath, the list is pretty much endless.\u000a\u000aThe CGI is just embarrassing. It looked like they worked very hard on some aspects, but others have almost no effort put into them, and it was really distracting.\u000a\u000aI found myself mostly just too frustrated at the script, the lackluster visuals and camera work to really enjoy the good aspects of the movie. It is a shame that many people will never read the book because the movie was such a trainwreck.

VWow, I was really disappointed in this sequel. There were so many vaudeville style scenes that were contrived, slapstick-ish, and to boot - really bad dialog and acting. The staged camera angles were first year student nonsense. It seemed that every fight scene tried to outdo any other ever made in speed, deftness, etc - all that meant to the audience was a blur of sword noises and the opportunity for seizures. The original Star Trek (the series) Klingon sounded more natural than the elvish and Ork noises I sat through, and more naturally delivered. The first Hobbit movie was so professional, so well done - this one is just a mess. Save your money and wait for the DVD.

VThe Hobbit the Desolation of Smaug\u000a\u000aJust a heads up: I loved the LOTR Trilogy, and I had/have some insane high hopes about The Hobbit Trilogy. And I really enjoyed the first film. I admit I was first a bit confused after viewing the first one, but after a second viewing (plus having watched all the behind the scenes material) I was convinced.\u000a\u000aNow... The Desolation of Smaug is a heck of a ride.\u000a\u000aI was worried when I read reviews that talked about a "fast paced" film, and it being a good thing. But now I know what they meant.\u000a\u000aYou get introduced to so many new places and people. And you'd think that would be bad since it's already hard to keep track of the dwarfs. But the pace of the film keeps the viewer interested at all times. \u000a\u000aWhen the new characters come in, we're given just enough time with them to fall in love with the characters. Thranduil, Tauriel, Bard, Beorn... They shine on screen, but again not more than they have to. We get much time with Bilbo and his journey, and of course with the dwarfs.\u000a\u000aIt's just intensely exciting, with great drama, great acting, thrilling action... I seriously lack words...\u000a\u000aAnd the ending... You want more...\u000a\u000aNow I never thought I'd say this... But this film is better than Return of the King... I NEVER thought those words would leave my mouth...\u000a\u000aEnjoy it..\u000a\u000a10/10\u000a\u000aEasiest 10 I've ever given...

VTo start off this movie was stupid and bad. I mean many other movies have successfully incorporated the use of battling a dragon. So this movie was particularly my worst film out of the horrible Hobbit franchise.\u000a\u000aI would only have 1 say for the beginning and end, why would there be many scenes where entertainment was out of the park. This movie would have been better if a deal of comedy and cool use of computer skills were involved in this terrible film.\u000a\u000aFinally, if you want a better deal of a bad movie there should have been way more normal use of comedy and drama instead of the terrible use of comedy and drama.\u000a\u000aMy final say would be try adding a sense of humour and more drama so you can be more sophisticated and add more intellectual use in using graphics.

VIt's one of those much discussed topics amongst the lovers of saga cinema, does The Hobbit live up to the splendor and magic of Frodo and his 10 odd cinema hours of Lord of the Rings adventures....After seeing this installment, I have to say with hand on heart, no. Using the formula of, New Zealand backdrop, Elves, Humans, Goblins and Auks, with a couple of LOTR characters thrown into the mix, but yet lacking a positive direction. It seemed to me that there were a whole pile of different scenarios and they were just thrown together to make this presentation. I spotted a couple toward the end, first was that people in Lake Town got the impression that the smaug was coming to destroy the town and kill them all, one of the main characters still had a black arrow that could be used as the only weapon to kill the beast, and then we see the Smaug arguing with Bilbo at the end and says he is going to destroy the town, then we don't see any of this, it should've happened. thus the ending of the film for me was a let down. One thing that is this movies saving grace is the visual splendor, the CGI pro quality that just shines all the way, loved that! Another thing I was not to impressed with was some of the battle scenes, particularly the one with the dwarfs and elves going down the river with the barrels, was just to fast and too much going on, and many action scenes were just that bit too fantastical. Many other critics of this movie have said that it is only about 30% faithful to the original book, but then what film is these days? Enjoyable romp of a film, but does leave itself a bit wide open to continuity and story line errors.

VI was hoping to be surprised with #2 after the oddities that strayed from the charming, effective story by the great linguist and teacher, Tolkein. Instead, previously admired movie director, Peter Jackson, and his creative assembly, have gone where no group has gone before. Part 2 of this needless trilogy is a joyless slog through made up characters which serve a non-story purpose and contain so much lengthy violence including stabbings and decapitations that it really buries the idea of the original story of Tolkein's The Hobbit.\u000a\u000aThe encounter with the spiders was just wrong. The clever language of spiders, and indeed most animals is suppressed, but the the language of Smaug is not. The encounter with the Wood Elves was odd in that they weren't approached by famished dwarfs desperately looking for food. The escape in the barrels was over a Class 5 rapids that could not possibly be used for commerce. Melted gold? So quickly ... so much ... and since we know dwarfs and hobbits are temperature sensitive, well ... what's the point? To make Smaug mad enough to attack the village? The village didn't throw the mysterious solid-then-molten gold on him, but that's where his anger is focused.\u000a\u000aOverall, it's not fun. The characters have no really happy moments. Gandalf makes strange decisions, none of them with a wink or twinkle of his eye, Radegast makes another appearance, and all of it is so serious and depressing that you may not want to finish the movie. I did, but just barely.\u000a\u000aThere is no need to put more "Tauriel" and Orlando Bloom's Legolas in the story. Although I love Bloom's Legolas, that was a different story. It takes away from the already limited time of the main character, uh Bilbo. The great man/bear Bjorn was well done and as scary as he needed to be. For my money, the extra orcs and wargs and the oddly provocative Pale Orc who appears more than Bilbo are a complete waste and change the narrative so that it becomes confused and completely inaccessible for children. By the way, the target audience for The Hobbit is children. Peter and Phillipa decided it was more important to make a trilogy with lots of action, violence, and ideas they gleaned from other sources, including their own imaginations, than to translate the best Hobbit ever made for the screen. Too bad.\u000a\u000aI really don't know what to expect for Part 3. Perhaps 15 armies and nuclear annihilation?

VI just finished watching the Desolation of Smaug and I'm sad to say I am quite disappointed and shocked that Peter Jackson has totally taken a great story and mixed it up so much that the original story is totally lost. Starting with the intro of Beorn was really messed up from how Gandalf introduced the dwarfs little by little with riddles to Beorn who does finally accept them into his home and gives them the help they need to continue their journey. You only see him once as the great bear he can turn into and it's done quite wrongly. Mirkwood was run through so quickly I didn't even think they actually went through there and the fight with the spiders was totally done completely wrong. Bilbo was invisible and harassing the spiders to no end while he's rescuing the dwarfs but we don't see that and how he humiliates the spiders and enrages them so and then them wandering from the path or Bombur falling into the enchanted stream, their capture by the elves and imprisoned and Bilbo the whole time invisible getting them out. True it's funny when he dumps them into the river and finds himself still inside the elves cellar and the way he look's around is a bit funny till he walks to the end and dumps himself in. The dwarfs are supposed to be sealed inside the barrels and the orcs and elves fighting along with the dwarfs was totally out of place and needless. \u000a\u000aThe addition of Legolas and Turiel was very unnecessary and took away from the story totally. I could go on and on about how this movie has totally wronged the whole story from the book and Tolkien is probably rolling over and over in his grave and screaming from Heaven, " WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY STORY?" It is kinda of a fun movie to watch but I still say, it is very disappointing if you are a devoted Tolkein fan of his books. I will buy the last edition when it comes out to see how they do the Battle of the Five Armies and what Bilbo does with the Arkenstone(if he even has it as it was never shown in this movie if he had it or not). Time will tell and I will have all the movies as well as the books in my library collection to pass on to my grandchildren and further on, I hope. \u000a\u000aEnjoy the movie for what this version shows but just know that Peter Jacksons interpretation is so way off to be very disappointing. \u000a\u000aSadly I only give this version of the trilogy just 3 *** and that is being generous.

VI was very disappointed with this movie. As usual the production is very good but, my God, did they have to mess with the story so much. Face it, the original story is as good as it gets to start with and just making the movie true to it would result in a great movie. But,nooooo, the fools who wrote and directed this movie had to think THEY could write a better story than what Tolken had written and, for me, ruined it. I was livid when the escape from the Mirkwood Elves lair was messed with and again when they changed the meeting with Smaug. Come on guys...This WAS an excellent story that really could not be improved on and all you did was mess it up. Who Can I Go To To Get My Money Back?

VThe only why i would give 4 stars to this film is because of really great visual effects and great atmosphere. Now lets go to things what i don't like. I really don't like childish and brainless story and events in this film. I really hope to live a day to watch LOR which isn't filmed for brainless people. I mean if you spend so much money and everything on film, please dnt make it brainless and so unrealistic. Lets add to that that no one important from good side of the party died in a single film to now. I mean really this kind of films when one side can do anything and get away with all in last sec is so stupid and depressing. Dragon looked like brainless rat, i almost throw up in some scenes that look so dumb that someone would think that someone purposely sabotage FILM THAT COULD BE SO MUCH MORE! I am so sad that i even watched this film. One more thing, they want to make Sauron look so frightful and strong, but only one thing this makes futile. It was a joke when "mighty" Sauron fall by the hand of one almost cripple woman. Sorry if i sounded like i am raging or something but i had to say what i feel and hope as i said that i would live a day when i could watch LOR which is more realistic and not so brainless, because i really like the LOR atmosphere.

VI didn't expect this movie to be so weak, it just doesn't live up to the standard of quality set by Lord of the ring trilogy, and i cannot believe same people were making it. I was thinking "what are they doing, why" the actions of the characters just didn't make sense, i couldn't get their motives and feelings, its like they just read their text blocks. Combat parts of the movie make me smile. There is no impact, no physics, so to say, in their strikes. it is just my impressions, i don't claim objectivity. it felt like big weapon swings of those orcs went into nothingness, when low weight character blocks something it should at least push them back. \u000a\u000aand this dragons scene just made me facepalm. they talk to him, then run, then talk again and it drags on. He destroyed that city when it had army and defenses and now couldn't handle a group of scared dwarfs))). Instead of just picking up the gem and running away from there, they were running around the whole place (possibly to show huge work vfx artists have done creating it) pushing and pulling some levers, and rotating wheels. then they somehow melted giant statue of a dwarf??? onto the dragon, dragon's feelings were hurt and he flew away saying something about revenge. If he wanted revenge why not kill those dwarfs right there, why did he fly away, he wasn't hurt or anything. OK maybe creators had their logic behind it, i just didn't get it. this smuggler guy takes out a hidden spear and runs outside, then gives it to his son and tells him to hide it??? but it was already hidden in his house))) just an example, this movie is full of such moments.

VThe road to the Lonely Mountain continues for our company of 15 (13 dwarfs + Gandalf + our titular Hobbit), taking them through an evil forest, a less-than-friendly encounter with the woodland elves, a mad barrel chase, and finally a confrontation with the great dragon Smaug.\u000a\u000aTwo films in and it's getting harder not to keep kicking the very dead horse that is the "2 vs 3 films" debate. And yet Jackson, that lovable, fan-boy geek of a filmmaker, has finally overstretched himself to the point where seams not only show, but are sometimes downright embarrassing. Turning a 1000 page book and its dense appendices into 10 hours of film was a wise decision. Stretching a novel under 200 pages to nearly the same length might well turn out to be a folly.\u000a\u000aThe Jacksonian touch is still present and strong, don't get me wrong: the main cast more than pull their weight with obvious mention to Martin Freeman's Bilbo - arguably a much better character than Frodo or Sam in the Ring epic - Ian McKellen's Gandalf and the now ubiquitous Benedict Cumberbatch as a very threatening Smaug. Certain set-pieces also up the ante on anything produced to date in the realm of adventure cinema: the nasty spider ambush, a demented barrel-chase that matches the best of Tex Avery, and the reveal of Smaug. A lot of the humorous touches are also not only welcome, but pulled off to perfection, even if they draw attention to the film's great weakness: its tone.\u000a\u000aThe Hobbit is a brisk, fun, children's story. It is an adventure, Indiana Jones to Lord of the Rings' War and Peace if you will. Bar one nearly poetic encounter by Gandalf in Dol Guldur, every attempt by Jackson to bring these Hobbit installments closer to Lord of the Rings makes them lesser, longer and messier films. \u000a\u000aDid we need a romantic triangle? Not really, especially one this devoid of consequence. Did anyone really want to see Legolas again? Or Frodo and old Bilbo in part 1 for that matter? No. A certain villain's appearance might be beautifully executed but for all the confusion it creates it might have been better to skip to the meat of this particular story. We only get to Smaug or any of his desolation the title refers to until 2/3 into this movie!\u000a\u000aWe all look back on the majesty and spectacle of the Lord of the Rings with genuine affection, but in the case of the Hobbit, less really would have been more, along with a more sustained focus on the elements that really work. And while we can look forward to more genius Jackson touches in part 3, given the sense of doom built up here and the number of subplots to bring to a close, intimacy probably isn't going to be that film's defining feature.\u000a\u000aMore's the pity.

V"You have nice manners for a thief and a liar!"\u000a\u000aPeter Jackson's latest journey to Middle Earth was to explore Smaug and introduce the audience to the battle of the five armies that will ensue in the final film. We find Thorin Oakenshield being thrusted into leading his merry gang of dwarf's to the Lonely Mountain as Gandalf intends to inspect the happenings of Dol Gulder. This film more notably than other Jackson/Tolkien films is incredibly bloated and overindulgent, filled with multiple sub plots that create a relatively exhausting feeling. The new script for the penultimate movie was comprised with various new characters not mentioned in the original novel; this in my opinion created an unnecessary diversion to the traditional tale and therefore disrupted the enjoyment and naturalistic fluency of the story.\u000a\u000a'The Desolation of Smaug' once again possesses amazing scenery of New Zealand intertwined with the story accompanied with an immersive soundtrack composed by Howard Shore, the direction of these films never seizes to amaze as the primary story line is perfectly encapsulated and terrific casting options provide a sentimental and emotional substance to this fantasy epic. The film has a thoroughly tedious opening act but as the film establishes the antagonists and setting, it propels into an intensified ambiance unparalleled by many other films. The riddle in the dark sequence with Gollum and Bilbo was commendably the most memorable scene in the entire unexpected journey film, yet unfortunately Martin Freeman was arguably underused in this film. Bilbo shared another memorably extended scene with his encounter with Smaug which was a beautiful use of CGI and fantastically voiced over by Benedict Cumberbatch, the scarily deep and loud tone sends shivers down your spine whilst Bilbo's witty flattery to survive against this beast is a terrifically entertaining combination.\u000a\u000aThe film tends to become host to some moronic and inane action sequences and experiences the occasional tasteless dialogue especially with the Elves and sub par delivery of key lines,it was rather disappointing from my perspective how the the characters had to continually rely on Legolas and Tauriel saving just in time and how these particular elves repetitively showed their skills monotonously. However the intended creative expansion on Bard the Bowman was impressive and Gollum not featuring in this movie was a somewhat substantial restraint given that Peter Jackson likes to connect and link all of his characters from his Middle Earth films. To witness the phenomenal spectacle Smaug makes up for the seemingly very long wait, despite his arguably disproportionate size in different shots it still compensates for the redundant sub- plots; for instance the love triangle between Kili, Tauriel and Legolas. I firmly believe that this tale would have been better as two, three hour movies rather than three, two and half movies. Problematic narrative flaws and raw characters wither the deep and passionate story of the dwarf's quest to Erebor.

VBilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is continuing his trek to Lonely Mountain, accompanying Bilbo are the 13 elves, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) the wizard, and Thorin (Richard Armitage) the King of the dwarfs. Once they find the mountain, they have to use the Key of Thorin to open a door carved into the Lonely Mountain. He must also find the Arkenstone, the royal gem of Erebor, and take on Smaug, the dragon. And he must do all this before sunset on Durin's Day. Before he gets to Lonely Mountain, there are many obstacles in Bilbo's way. He seeks refuge with Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt) and then has to fight giant spiders in Mirkwood Forest. They escape the spiders only to be arrested by the Elvin King, Thanduil. (Lee Price) Bilbo and company escapes the Elvin prison in barrels only to run into a band of Orcs. The attack is repelled by Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly)\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Gandalf has split from the group with Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) to find the Necromacer, also known as Sauron. Before getting to Lonely Mountain, Bilbo and the dwarfs must go through the burgh of Laketown with the help of Bard, (Luke Evans) to get weapons. Thorin also tries to negotiate the return of Laketown to the dwarfs, Thorin promises to share the gold from Lonely Mountain with the people of Laketown. They accept Thorin's proposal. By the time Bilbo and the dwarfs gets to Lonely Mountain, the sun is setting, and they cannot find the keyhole. Bilbo has the ring which gives him invisibility, but will he get a chance to use it against Smaug? Does Gandalf find Sauron?\u000a\u000aThe last 40 minutes if the Desolation of Smaug is well worth watching. The chemistry between Freeman and Cumberbatch crackles with tension. Getting to that last 40 minutes, however is a long, hard slog. Peter Jackson has again taken a simple story, and made it a bloated, unrecognizable mess. He could have scaled back on Legolas and Tauriel, he could have scaled back on Laketown and skipped the love triangle between Legolas, Tauriel and Kili altogether, but all the minutia was there. I haven't read the Hobbit or any other Tolkien, but all the minutia made for dull watching. The problem is, every sci-fi movie since Star Wars has to be an epic trilogy, the Lord of the Rings was an epic trilogy, so the movie makers, for purely pecuniary reasons, made the Hobbit a trilogy, and it's the audience who suffers. The Hobbit movies also suffer by comparison to the Lord of the Rings trilogy which was a rich tapestry of story and characters, which built to an incredible climax, the Hobbit will never match the magic of the Lord of the Rings movies.\u000a\u000aThe acting is fine, especially by Cumberbatch, Freeman, and Ian McKellen. The movie is best when the three are on screen. When the movie shifts away from the three characters they play, the movie suffers. Evangeline Lilly and Orlando Bloom do their best, but their storyline just didn't interest me. Richard Armitage is pretty forgettable as Thorin.\u000a\u000aThe pacing is very slow at points, and I noticed that the landscapes, which were pretty spectacular in the first Hobbit movie, were somewhat ordinary, the CGI budget seemed mostly to be poured into the talking spiders, and Smaug, and I must say, Smaug is a special effects marvel, but still not spectacular enough to maintain a 2 hour and 20 minute movie.\u000a\u000aFor more fire-breathing reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com

VI honestly can't see why everyone loves this film so much. It is nothing like the book, and though people are saying don't go into it expecting to see Tolkien's Hobbit, I at least expected to see something similar since this is credited as an adaptation of the original novel. What I got was a horrible bloated version of the Hobbit that barely resembles Tolkien's work. What's worse is the terribly cheesy love story edited in for a longer run time and more content and the often clichéd script. CGI is too frequently used (even the horses are computer generated). The giant super-soldier orcs are horribly obviously fake. What made the orcs from LOTR so awesome is that they were actual actors armed with a legion of prostetics. Here we get dwarfs mowing down monster orcs effortlessly, all while fleeing from elves in barrels flying down a river. Character's motives are unclear and instead of getting you involved with the characters, we get dwarfs whose names (unless you are dedicated to the book) you don't even remember chopping off Orc heads every thirty minutes like they are performing tricks. Plus the soundtrack is just boring. Anyways, it's a horribly made movie, made horribly just so they could squeeze three movies out of a 250 page book.

VI have to warn you that I am a huge Tolkien fun, have read the books 3 times and seen the Lord of the Rings movies more times than i can remember. This movie was in one word disappointing, and this is not due to the fact that they have totally disregarded the actual book and invented entire piles of new (and often lame stuff). The hobbit is a children's story not meant to be epic or a 3 movie thing. A simple, relatively small movie would suffice. I would really like to see 3 epic movies from Peter Jackson on the SIlmarillion. The audience of the Hobbit seems to e targeted at 15 year old. It simply does not do justice to either the book or the Lord of the RIngs movies.

VLots of people seemed to feel the first Hobbit film was too slow, while the second nicely picked up the pace. Personally, I see the reverse.\u000a\u000aThe first film was slow, but to some purpose. The lengthy intro in Hobbitton gives us some worthwhile characterization. As the expedition moves through the wild, the action builds to a suitable climax. It's all a bit overblown and over-hyped, but it works.\u000a\u000aIn the second film, it's one endless action sequence after another. Barrel-riding on the river (in open, easily-swamped barrels) turns into a ludicrous extravaganza of 3D heroics by two characters who aren't even in the book - and who therefore can do nothing to advance the storyline of the movie. But the final battle with Smaug is even worse - an endless barrage of increasingly implausible CG-rendered escapades, which again have nothing whatsoever to contribute to the story - given that in the book, the dwarfs never actually meet Smaug at all.\u000a\u000aWhat's particularly galling is that Jackson actually OMITS some of the best parts of the book. The arrival at Beorn's house, in the previous film, skips the clever introduction of the dwarfs, two at a time - a classic fairy-tale passage. The trek through the woods, which in the book extends to weeks of gloom, terror and privation, is reduced to a ridiculous, brilliantly-lit slug-fest with special-effects spiders.\u000a\u000aThe endless interludes with Gandalf, Radagast and Sauron are well filmed, but obviously needless. It's like an extended product-placement: a trailer for the Lord of the Rings trilogy edited right into an unrelated story.\u000a\u000aI did like Stephen Fry's performance as the Master of Laketown, and I liked the image of Smaug. Aside from that, there's very little excuse for this film. It not only fails to capture the spirit - or even the major events - of the book, it's dead boring as a piece of cinema.\u000a\u000aI can understand Peter Jackson reaching for a big box of Tolkien Helper in order to extend these movies to such extreme length. But it might have been better if he'd waited till he ran out of actual Tolkien.\u000a\u000a(BTW: my apologies for the misspelling of "dwarves" - IMDb keeps changing it.)

VNothing short of a good visual treat with impressive movie set-design again from the director who brought one of the finest trilogy with the crew of over 800 in LOTR-ROTK. Initially it was said that Guillermo del Toro would direct this movie. But finally it came to Peter Jackson. A decent story, yet deviated too much from the novel and since its neither the first nor the final part of the trilogy, there ain't expectation of an ending to the story. There are too much action scenes and times I felt like the team aimed to show off their CGI stuffs and for the Video game consoles.\u000a\u000aMy review for this movie is that it is adventurous with awesome camera work with CGI but too much deviated from the novel. My stars are just for the special effects and the actors and not for story.

VWhatever happened to The Hobbit?\u000a\u000aAlthough, we know that The Hobbit is not really the perfected 9,000+ words book we are seeing on the big screen since it has been chunked into three parts with a detailed story that is hugely modified; we are expecting a revamped re-imagination of it.\u000a\u000aAnd although I'm not a huge fan of Lord of the Rings series (including The Hobbit), I'm sad to say that I have my own standards when it comes to adaptations; and The Desolation of Smaug (Or the two Hobbit series) did not impress me.\u000a\u000aNot even the 45 frame rate nor the visually entertaining VFX did not live up to the expectation. The usual Peter Jackson three/four adventures in a movie, which I noticed ever since LotR and Percy Jackson, is present in both The Hobbit and Desolation.\u000a\u000aI have to admit the action sequences in Desolation is quite impressive and is upbeat which gives the movie a joyous moment, and I have to admit also that Legolas is the star no matter what; outshining every character present in the movie which, Legolas, was not really present in the source material in The Hobbit book. Good thing for Peter Jackson to put the coolness back, but I'm pretty sure, fans of the Tolkien epic is not happy.\u000a\u000aThe depth of the story is somewhat garbled and confusing, but I know it will be summed up in the third film. And I don't like how hanging Desolation was. Unlike the LotR series, it has satisfactory hanging by the end of the first and second book; but in Desolation, it was crunch anguish I felt, and when the screen faded, I then asked my partner if how did he feel; he said it was 'okay' and I know it's not the best. And Desolation has reached one step to the climax but then cuts, so it made me feel angry.\u000a\u000aAnd one more thing, I don't quite understand why it's titled 'Desolation of Smaug' when I know Desolation means something empty or destruction. Enlighten me, people.\u000a\u000aThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is directed by Peter Jackson.

VIt takes less time to read the entire book than watch one installment of this "trilogy". Peter Jackson must have needed work badly to participate in, or create this overblown epic.\u000a\u000aI find it shocking that viewers have rated it above 8. Yes, it looks good. That and the fact that there's hardly any toilet humor, except in the most literal sense, are the only reasons I rated it as high as 5. Beyond that, it suffers J.K. Rowling syndrome,i.e., the love of one's own voice and the inability to edit. Or is the motivation monetary? The action sequences are too numerous and too long. Indeed, everything is too long.\u000a\u000aThe charm of the book is nowhere to be found. Well, I did notice Martin Freeman trying to inject some at a couple of points, but his efforts are are lost in a sea of effects and needless action. Also, there can't be any climax because everything is so amped up from the start. When not amped up, it's needlessly dreary. Is Kiwi weather relentlessly gray or something?\u000a\u000aFinally, I'm getting sick of movie-makers changing books and adding characters to suit their own vision, or please some imagined demographic. People love a good story. I do. But this one's so bogged down by effluvium that I can't imagine sitting through the opening credits again, let alone the entire flick. \u000a\u000aThe entire trilogy boiled down into one two-hour (maximum) movie. That I might watch. That's what it should have been. Otherwise, they won't get any more money out of me. I'm officially in protest. You should be too.

VI saw the 3DH version of this movie, and really wish I'd seen the 2D version instead. The movie itself was decent, but not in the same class as LoTR. The drastically overdone 3D filming really cheapened the movie. Multiple times, I got the feeling I was watching a movie set rather than a movie. It was a lot like watching a made-for-TV movie where the director/producer wanted to focus the movie making on making it look cool in 3D rather than in making a good movie.\u000a\u000aThe worst part was the ridiculous bee flying up to the audience's face.\u000a\u000aI believe it is possible to make a great 3D movie, but Desolation of Smaug is NOT it.\u000a\u000aIf I took my glasses off (and ignored the blurriness) I was able to enjoy the movie better.

VDear Peter Jackson;\u000a\u000aCall me old fashioned.\u000a\u000aWhen I watch a movie (read a book, listen to a song, etc.) I have an expectation that there will actually be an ending. You did that with the LOTR trilogy, and with the first Hobbit movie. But this one...it didn't end. It just stopped.\u000a\u000aI actually stood up in the theater when the screen went black and let out a scream: "Noooooooooo."\u000a\u000aOK, granted. It is hard to turn a single novel into a movie trilogy. That was the advantage you had with LOTR. Each book had it's own conclusion written by a master story teller. Three independent stories. So, given that, maybe you shouldn't have tried to turn one rather average length novel into three more-than-full-length feature films. You were bound to have problems stretching it that far.\u000a\u000aBut to end it where it did. Really, Peter? This isn't TV. This isn't a season ending cliff hanger. It is a feature film. It needs an ending in order to satisfy your audience. \u000a\u000aOne problem with Hollywood-from its beginning-is the inability to end a story. Screen writers have always had this trouble. Novelists always seem to end their stories well, why can't screen writers?\u000a\u000aThere would have several logical places to end it. The most logical would have been when we first saw Smaug. Smaug opens his eyes, we see the look on Bilbo's face followed by a teaser. Another logical place to end would be after the killing of Smaug, which we know is coming (and who is going to kill him). There would have been cheering and a happy ending, and perhaps a teaser about what was coming next. Even during the battle when it is unclear4 whether Smaug or the people will win. \u000a\u000aBut that didn't happen.\u000a\u000aBut it just stopped.\u000a\u000aStopped.\u000a\u000aNo ending.\u000a\u000aI'll give you credit where it is due. The production design was beautiful, the green screen was as expertly accomplished as we have come to expect from you. The characters were very well developed-particularly Thorin and Balin and Kili. They came a long was since the first film and all the characters had a greater depth, perhaps more than Mr. Tolkien had conceived. Character prosthetics were absolutely gorgeous.\u000a\u000aThe effects were a bit over the top but you did have a lot of time to fill, so I will give you a pass on that. We kind of expect that now. But my feeling here is that just because you can, does not mean you should.\u000a\u000aAs for the story-with a strong story from a master story teller you had more meat on the bones than most film makers. Who could lose?\u000a\u000aIn fact, Peter, you had me absolutely hooked. I was right there (suspending disbelief when I needed to), feeling the tension build, feeling sympathy for the good guys and hatred for the bad guys. Tension during the epic battles-Orcs vs. the world, Gandalf vs. Sauron. Tension when Bilbo is discovered by Smaug. Very well executed. \u000a\u000aBut you absolutely lost me when Smaug delivered the last line and the screen went black.\u000a\u000aNaughty, naughty Peter Jackson. That is no way to treat an audience. You did not give us the respect that we are due. It was just crassness, plain and simple, obvious that you were milking the story for the money. You forgot our needs. Naughty, naughty.\u000a\u000aMy prediction: you will end up losing between one third and one half you audience for the final film...all because you stopped the story abruptly, instead of giving the story a resolution-an ending, and the respect for the audience that we deserve.

V'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' certainly had its flaws, but ultimately I felt that the good outweighed the bad. With 'Desolation of Smaug', the decision by Peter Jackson to expand the story not only ruins this film, but it undermines the drama of the 'Lord of the Rings' saga that follows.\u000a\u000aBloated, clunky and filled with inconsequential action, 'Smaug' is a lumbering mess of a film. Every single addition serves only to bog the story down.\u000a\u000aIroncally, one of the themes of 'Smaug' is greed, and greed is exactly what ruins this film.

VFor people who have not read the book: 6 stars (OK, not great) For those who have read the book: 1 star (awful)\u000a\u000aThis movie was, to put it bluntly, meh. \u000a\u000aFirst of all, I'm a die-hard Tolkien fan. I've read the Lord of the Rings series several times, and the Hobbit several more. I've read the Silmarillion, and even some of Tolkien's non-canonical works that were published posthumously by his son. To me, the Lord of the Rings movie series were almost perfect. Although they deviated from the plot in (mostly) minor ways, they portrayed the spirit of the books exceedingly well, and had amazing special effects and great actors/actresses. \u000a\u000aThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was very good as well. It annoyed me a bit that they added the white orc and some other (seemingly) minor details, but it's Hollywood and they have the right to take certain liberties. \u000a\u000aHowever, the Desolation of Smaug was ridiculous. It's pretty good as a movie, and I'm sure people who haven't read the books will enjoy it. However, if you know anything at all about the original story, you'll know that this is not it. The vast majority of the movie had absolutely nothing to do with the book. At the very beginning, the company arrives at Beorn's house. Beorn was one of my favorite characters in the book, but I couldn't help hating him in the movie. Later, the company escapes from the elves in barrels. There was no fight in the book, but the movie takes a solid ten minutes or more as we watch Bombur bounce along the shore, killing orcs every time he lands, while Legolas, a female elf (I forget her name) and the rest of the dwarfs fight against orcs sent to kill the dwarfs. Arriving in Lake Town, the dwarfs are once again attacked by orcs who invade the city while Kili almost dies from a poisoned arrow wound. Eventually Thorin and company leave for the mountain, leaving four of the dwarfs behind in Lake Town. After Bilbo sneaks into the mountain, the dwarfs actually fight Smaug.\u000a\u000aNone of these things happened in the book, though they are a large majority of the movie. Many of the fights seem completely over the top and unrealistic, even for a fantasy movie. There is a strange romance going on with Kili and the elf lady, which seems to be just thrown in, in hopes of attracting more of the sentimental audience. The fight with Smaug never happened, and even the scene with the spiders was completely different from the book. They also left out several important parts from the book, and very little of the original plot remains. \u000a\u000aAll in all, it seemed like the movie was just haphazardly thrown together with no thought for the story or for any sort of continuity. It's as if the producers just thought "yes, we're making a movie about the Hobbit, but Tolkien didn't know what he was doing, we can write something SOOO much BETTER!!!" and then failed miserably. It would have been a ten-star movie if they had simply stuck to the plot of the book. It also appears as if they really just wanted to show off their fantastic special effects in whatever way possible, so they added a ton of random unnecessary fights, including a massive battle between Smaug and the dwarfs. Or rather, between Smaug and 9 of the dwarfs, since they left four behind. This is completely out of character, and it makes Thorin out to be a much more selfish and uncaring person than he is. The only redeeming factor in this movie is Bilbo. Martin Freeman does an excellent job portraying this little Hobbit who is slowly finding his courage. \u000a\u000aThe only explanation I can think of is that the directors and producers wanted to make this movie a prequel to The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is not a prequel, it is an almost completely unrelated story. But I'm sure they thought they could make more money from a prequel for fans who haven't read the books and wouldn't know any better. \u000a\u000aDo yourself a favor: read the book. This movie is OK if you don't compare it to the book, but it's not great. And when compared to Tolkien's work, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug looks like a mockery. I hope they do better on the next one, but I am quickly losing my faith in this trilogy. As an avid Tolkien fan, I was severely disappointed.

VAlthough an OK movie as movies go, it was a let down to those expecting any relevance to the original story. I was impressed by the first of the Hobbit trilogy because the amount of creative license was acceptable. It stayed within the original plot and story. The Desolation of Smaug took that license way too far. It shifted the original plot of the book so far askew that I am not sure I will even go see the last of the trilogy. I see no way to turn the 3rd episode back to even remotely regain the magic of the original story. This was just another movie, lots of CGI and action. Thank goodness it is full of decent actors because otherwise it would be just another cheap imitation. I was really let down Peter Jackson sold out on this. Up until this movie, the series was a wonderful rendition of a great book. This was just another movie, the magic is gone.\u000a\u000aP.S. Maybe Elves age backwards because Legolas sure looked a lot older in this than he did in the Lord of the Rings. A small detail but, well, doesn't make it any easier to accept the other disappointments.

VThere is nothing wrong with CGI. There is nothing wrong with action movies, even when they are written as epic fantasy. Yet, it seems that this "episode" of Hobbit aims at the audience that isn't very demanding.\u000a\u000aIf you enjoy endless action-packed sequences with a lot of special effects, this might be a movie for you. But if you want to see Tolkien's book brought to screen, even the 1977 animation movie is better choice than Peter Jackson's effort.\u000a\u000aEssentially, this movie can be described as Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) that meets Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy (2004) in a world imagined by J.R.R. Tolkien. The Lord of the Rings trilogy set the bar high, but this movie didn't even try to reach it...

VTHE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG 12/25/13\u000a\u000aPeter Jackson, the wonderful maestro of the magical world of Middle Earth has now directed THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG, the second in a trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's great novel The Hobbit, prequel to The Lord of The Rings, and it is another big budget film, and more importantly to the studios and its investors, a huge successful moneymaker. Looking at the closing credits took at least 15 minutes – filled with name upon name of all those involved in the making of this spectacular "much of the same" and for me alas a yawning bore of a cinema experience.\u000a\u000aMy problem with the film is that it felt like last year's model, the territory including the mood and "light" is visually too familiar. The landscape and special effects are panoramic, both natural and artificial – products of the digital age we live in - filled with fierce, snarling animals, teeth bared accompanying equally vicious and savage creatures called Orcs, along with gigantic spiders weaving viscous entangling webs, and a rapacious fire-breathing flying dragon, Smaug – of the title - who resides in The Lonely Mountain protecting his copious bounty of purloined coins and jewels.\u000a\u000aDespite the inclusion of many of the same actors such as Gandalf the Wizard (a bit more bedraggled Ian McKellan) who can still conjure up enchanted divinations, and the beautiful Orlanda Bloom, heroic as ever as an Elvin Prince, I felt confused by the addition of characters that were never in the original book. I can accept a director creating composites in their screenplays that diverge from the book, but this time it was at the expense of the wonderful Bilbo Baggins (delightfully played by an often bewildered Martin Freeman,) the brave Hobbit who reluctantly again leads a band of 13 dwarfs on their urgent quest to reclaim their homeland, the dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the overlord of Middle Earth, Smaug, the green- eyed, molten bellied monstrosity, at any moment primed to expectorate flames annihilating all those who step into his realm. Unfortunately, Bilbo's humanity disappears in the CGI effects, and for much of this barely under three-hour movie, he is an ancillary personage in the plot. One inclusion I did respond to was that of a female Elfin warrior Tauriel (lovely Evangeline Lilly,) who is excellent at her craft and refreshingly human, inserted into this practically all-male cast to attract female audiences, creating a whisper of a possible "interspecies" romance.\u000a\u000aThe most intriguing part of THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG addresses the age-old question of isolationism vs. interventionism in the face of dictatorial chieftains preparing to expand their territory. Absolute power vs. the exploited; tribal factions, self-interest, and ethnic purity with its accompanying disdain for the "other," are still recognizable in our contemporary universe. The grab for world superiority aligned with the corrupting dominance of lucre is never-ending, and the fictional Middle Earth is no exception.

VNow let me start of by saying that the movie itself is not terrible! I actually kind of enjoyed the movie, but there were some severely dis- heartening parts to it for someone who has read the book multiple times since a very young age.\u000a\u000aPROLOGUE- Let me begin with how the movie starts. We're thrust into a flashback to the night Gandalf and Thorin met, which was actually a very good scene, but what is it doing at the beginning of the second film? It definitely felt like something that should have been at the beginning of the the first instalment.\u000a\u000aBEORN- Then we pick up right where we left off! the gang are escaping Azog and his pack who is still hunting them, as well as this mysterious bear figure...Us book readers will know this is Beorn. In the book the scenes with beorn are actually quite long, the hobbits stay and chat to him for quite a long time and they also have a feast that is organized by animals under his control. YET, none of this was used in the film! his scene was very short lived and rushed and to top it off, he looked bad as well! more like something that belonged in the Narnia universe than middle earth.\u000a\u000aMIRKWOOD- After Beorn's house we're treated to a quick (less than 2 minutes) small shot sequence of them travelling on horse back, and then they're almost immediately at mirkwood! at this point I wasn't letting the rush bother me too much because I thought mirkwood would be a long winded part of the movie! I was so wrong, it started off well, with the gang following the path and having to stop and move leaves to fin it again BUT,once the y lose the track of good, we're treated to another short shot sequence of them acting all hight and tripping out (Yes they did completely miss out the magical river). Then we reach the point with the spiders! which is probably my favourite part of the whole book, its a huge part in the book! that emphasizes that Bilbo is starting to change, in the film it does this but nowhere near as well, not too much to say about this scene, it was enjoyable in both book and film, but lacked detail in the film! it was also nice to see bilbo naming his sword.\u000a\u000aELF KINGDOM/BARRELS- I have no negative comments to say about the wood elf kingdom, and the barrel escape! both scenes were excellent and matched my imaging of them from reading the book many years ago.\u000a\u000aLAKE TOWN- I enjoyed the laketown scenes in the beginning! it looked just as I had imagined. the characters were all as expected too, one thing I didn't like was when we constantly returned there to check on Kili who had been wounded and did not go with the rest of the gang, along with Fili and bofur.\u000a\u000aEREBOR- Here's where I was willing to forget everything else and enjoy the hell out of the movie! the entire part of the movie that takes part in erebor is amazing! smaug and bilbo's dialogue is great and felt so much like the book! the dwarfs plotting against smaug and trying their best to outwit and kill him, ALL AMAZING!.\u000a\u000aENDING- The amazing erebor scene was soon destroyed, when the ending so abruptly and poorly placed came into existence. Smaug takes off from the mountain and heads to lay waste to laketown (another amazing part of the book)"I am fire, I am death" by smaug was the perfect build up to the destruction, yet we were fed a line from bilbo "what have we done" and then credits.\u000a\u000aIn conclusion, I'm very aware that PJ cannot put all of the book into the movies! but he misses out some really good detail in some of the best parts! so to finish things off, a very good film with a rushed beginning a nice amazingly enjoyable bulky middle and a indescribably disappointing ending.

VAnother long journey that pretty much delivers exactly what is expected of it. Frankly, I found that to be mostly a bore. The film has some nice action moments but too much of it felt like bad CGI. What could only be called the super powers displayed by the elves as they slaughter orges left and right actually pulled me out of the movie. It really gave off a video game vibe to me. Also, the chapter feel has grown tired because yet again they don't end the film but rather set up the finale. Despite the large budget, this effort felt very lackluster and I really did expect better. This coming from a fan of the trilogy. I really lowered my expectations after the first effort but this continuation is just more of the same but at a limper ratio.

VThe whole movie was disappointing. I'll just try to sum the things:\u000a\u000a1) The CGI effects looked really fake, especially the part where Legolas jumps over the dwarfs' heads 2) There were some cheesy scenes, especially the ones between Tauriel and Kili, which were completely needless 3) The whole movie looked like someone skipped the first 30 minutes and cutted the last 30 4) The constant mentioning and showing The One Ring, although this is a prequel of the events in Lord of the Rings Trilogy and no one knows at this point the power of the Ring 5) And finally - the silly looking fights, the decapitations.... seriously???\u000a\u000aThis movie is totally disappointing in terms of expectations.

VI watched the "Unexpected Journey" some time ago and got around seeing this one for free. After seeing the first of the Hobbit films I didn't expect much, the goofy Disney feeling I got from the first movie continued deep into this one. \u000a\u000aWhat I liked about this movie was Smaug, he is an interesting character with a lovely voice actor. I'd love to see some deeper information about each and every one of the dwarfs as someone who didn't read the books have zero clues about who they are besides the little info given occasionally throughout the movie + the scene at Bilbo's home in the first flick. \u000a\u000aTons of "Pirates of the Caribbean"-styled goofs, few noteworthy scenes, flashing camera angles and an out of the air-love story between the filler character Tauriel and one of the dwarfs.\u000a\u000aI have no clue as how to this movie managed to achieve this kind of IMDb score.

VTo be honest I did not expect much from this movie. It was clear to me from the beginning that „The Hobbit" is too short a book to be made into three separate movies. And it shows. Not much happens in „Desolation of Smaug". Our heroes meet some elves, among them our hero from LOTR, Legolas who is at this time of his life very different character but that's OK. Then our hero fight some orks, some spiders and finally reach the Lake City which I must say is nicely thought out, we didn't have this kind of architecture or culture in LOTR. There we have the exact scene from „The Fellowship" when a female elf saves our dwarfish hero from certain death from a poisonous Morgul-arrow. Then they go to the Lonely Mountain where they fight Smaug, but are unable to defeat him. He escapes and flies to the Lake City in order to destroy it. That's about it. Hopefully the third installment of the series will be better then this, but who knows? The movie is not a complete waste of time but unfortunately all that happens, all the sound and fury in the end doesn't signifies anything.

VI enjoyed the first film, though it may have been long, I was still left fulfilled when I left the cinema. So of course I was excited for the sequel and boy was I disappointed.\u000a\u000aIt all just felt rushed. The characters didn't seem to have much about them and the story itself was filled with (seemingly) pointless subplots. I have never read The Hobbit myself so I wouldn't know if all of this was necessary, but to me it seemed irrelevant.\u000a\u000aThe one positive thing I will say about The Desolation of Smaug is that the special effects were spot on and the dragon looked immense as well as the action being pretty decent itself.

VI was disappointed. \u000a\u000aThe story picks up with... wait, how did the last one end? It was so long ago. And then they go to Lonely Mountain. Something about the dwarfs, apparently. There's some trouble on the way, but Bilbo bails them out. More trouble, more Bilbo saving the day. More trouble... you get the idea. Predictable should have this movie next to the entry in the dictionary.\u000a\u000aSpecial effects were sometimes really good (the light vs. dark battle), and sometimes head-shakingly poor. The barrel ride down the river was cartoonish and completely unbelievable - apparently barrels can go completely underwater and come up without any water in them. I was literally shaking my head watching that scene, it was so bad.\u000a\u000aI lost count of how many Orcs an Elf can kill in one second without getting a scratch, or slowing down the Orcs. I also got tired of the 'slay the orcs' choreography. It was a grind - like playing a poorly designed flash game.\u000a\u000aAnd then there's the story. I like a movie that has a story line, preferably involving characters that we get to know a bit along the way. This was more like a string of special effects shot, with a plot line - no plot, just a line. I like Tolkein because of the story. He was a story teller. This movie did not tell a story. Things happened in a sequence, but nothing really developed along the way.\u000a\u000aI wanted to like this movie as much as the first. I tried to like it. But my advice for this one: wait until it comes out in the 3-part DVD set.

VWhen I saw The Hobbitt, I thought it was one book and one additional movie. I was surprised when the first movie ended that they split it into two movies.\u000a\u000aWhen Smaug also didn't end, my wife and I were like "what?" Really, you cannot fit one book into 6 hours of film. At this point, Peter Jackson has jumped the shark and is just looking to rip off customers.\u000a\u000aSo off the one book, there is not a second trilogy. Really? Compare the quality it terms of plot and character development to the first trilogy. Not even close. Why? Cause the material should have been fit into ONE MOVIE not three.\u000a\u000aWe all agreed... at this point, we have no desire to see the next one. Great, the dragon attacks the town, gets shot down by the arrow, and the Dwarfs re-take the mountain. LEt's see, Peter might be able to fit that in about 20 minutes plus another 2.5 hours of Ork fights.\u000a\u000aI think we'll opt to spend out dollars on How to Train a Dragon II -much better use of our entertainment dollars. And I'll bet it comes to an end!!!

VWe're two down and one film to go in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy. The Desolation of Smaug wasn't screened to media outlets in the much criticised High Frame Rate format that tainted An Unexpected Journey. This mode will be available to the public but seeing the film in the standard 3D aesthetic is a treat. The 3D visuals are clear and unintrusive and there is occasionally a selective 3D long shot that provides depth to some of the narrow spaces of Middle-earth, such as the entrance of a spooky forest. Some of the early monsters that Bilbo Baggins (reprised by Martin Freeman) confronts are also scarier and feel more dangerous due to the tight close-ups, like a giant spider that gnashes its fangs in the forefront of the frame. In the final quarter, the dragon Smaug emerges as an astonishing visual achievement, with believable heft and weight provided by Benedict Cumberbatch's booming baritone voice and piercing eyes, as much as the superbly detailed computer animations. \u000a\u000aYet a scene where Bilbo sees a glorious sunset, before he is pulled back into the entangled branches of the forest, epitomises the way the beauties of this world are lost inside a numbingly bloated combat movie. For as much as Smaug is a technical improvement over its predecessor, the screenplay is still disappointingly shallow and the pacing is glacial. Unlike The Lord of the Rings trilogy, where a poignant friendship forged the heart of the story, Peter Jackson's Hobbit films have no thematic goals or subtext that can transcend good and evil. His chief concerns are the countless ways that he can decapitate Orc monsters and finding new reasons to enslave and then free Bilbo, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) and the other dwarfs. Each of the narrative's episodes are written around elaborate, overstretched action set pieces, such as barrel riding down a river, where plausible physics are gleefully disregarded, ultimately minimising the damage and dramatic tension faced by Bilbo and his fellowship.\u000a\u000aAlthough less linear than the previous film and opening multiple subplots, the script is extremely light on characterisation. The opening scenes look promising because the once reserved Bilbo is now becoming possessed by the powers of the One Ring. It makes him hungrier and greedier but the internal conflict goes unexplored. Bilbo and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) are the series' two best characters but they're also marginalised by side stars that are difficult to care about. Jackson and his three co-writers (including Guillermo del Toro) needlessly continue to import characters from The Lord of the Rings, even though they aren't in Tolkien's original story, and invent new ones too. Elven archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom) makes an unwelcome return in an unnecessary, boring love triangle involving himself, a newly written ninja-like archer named Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Kili (Aidan Turner), a wounded dwarf. This thread makes the narrative painfully slow and flabby, while the film's quietest moments are burdened by such gloomy clunkers as "with every victory this evil will grow" and "the enemy is preparing for war". \u000a\u000aThe scene I liked best in the film is Bilbo's confrontation with Smaug inside the Lonely Mountain. This is a powerful sequence and beautifully framed. It opens with a wide shot of the dragon's lair littered with gold and then the camera tightens onto the sleeping dragon's twitching eye. The scene works because rather than throwing us into mindless combat, it forces us to imagine the very worst for Bilbo so that's it's suspenseful and psychologically inevitable. Yet typical of the film, it becomes too much of a good thing. It is also interrupted by Peter Jackson's insistence on expanding the universe by rudely cutting back to the side stories. Despite an admittedly sharp cliff-hanger ending, it is the tardiness of the story and the deliberate, unresolved turgidness of this series in general which lingers more than any desire for another three hour film about the dwarfs reclaiming their real-estate. Hopefully There and Back Again is a tighter film, with stronger character development and fewer magic doors.

VPeter Jackson's ego that was held at bay all through the previous installment breaks free in this one. The lighthearted atmosphere from the book, that shone so brightly over the 1st part of the his version of the Hobbit, is no longer here, the strange story lines that were added to tie every thing together so no loose end is left and everyone watching the film knows that Peter Jackson did tell us all there was to know. An exact opposite of Tolkien's original who kept always saying (or implying) that middle earth has much more to it than he could ever cover with his stories. It's a difference in egos that doesn't always work for Jackson. Even though he did create a magnificent fantasy epic. Much darker than the first part, much more action packed very high quality of acting performances by all involved. The sins against the original book aren't as grave as those he committed with his LoTR trilogy, mainly because the Hobbit as I already said is a simpler story that doesn't allow for miss representations of the author's intentions. Jackson simply had to invent all these from scratch.\u000a\u000aI'm all for re-imagining a story, but if you do so at least be honest and tell us that's what you did, like Tim Burton did when he made his version of Alice. Jackson never said any such thing, if he did it was kept a secret from most of the viewers, which is plain shame as far as I'm concern. I know everyone is going to hate this review to pieces, so many "Jacksoners" are following every bit of film he creates trampling in their wake over all those who dare oppose him. But I personally think that had he kept himself closer to the original, he would've ended with a better movie. It was so with the first part, but I feel like his ego couldn't share the credit with the original author anymore, so that's what we got. It's fun to watch - it's just a different story we're watching than the one we were promised.

VThe first entry of The Hobbit trilogy was met with a mixed reaction by some, being too light, too comic and too long. The second film, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the shortest movie in the series, strives for a much darker tone and begins to weave many of the trilogies plot lines together.\u000a\u000aThorin (Richard Armitage), Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and the company of Dwarfs continuing their quest to The Lonely Mountain, in order to defeat the dragon Smaug (Bendict Cumberbatch) and reclaim the throne of Erebor. On their perilous journey through Mirkwood, the company end up clashing with the Elves, led by King Thranduil (Lee Pace) and Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) of Lake-town. These two characters are but a few that hinder their journey before the final day of Autumn. A creature known as The Necromancer (also Cumberbatch) is summoning Orcs to the ruins of Dol Guldur, forcing Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to also face the new threat.\u000a\u000aThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a movie that contains sub-plots galore. Outside the main plot, involving the Dwarfs, Gandalf cleanses Dol Guldur, Thranduil attempts to shelter his people in his borders, the political rivalries between Bard and The Master of Lake-town (Stephen Fry), Bilbo suffering from the effects of The Ring, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), the Captain of the Thranduil, guards wanting the elves to face the Orc threat and a love triangle between Taureil, Thranduil's son Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Kili the dwarf (Aiden Turner). That a is a lot to handle even for a film that is 161 minutes long and for someone of Peter Jackson's previous experience in Middle Earth, some of the subplots get sidelined. The subplot involving Bilbo's corruption and hearing voices in his head is a presence at the beginning movie, but is ignored later on.\u000a\u000aThe Hobbit is short novel and straight adaptation would have been a 2 hour, 30 minute movie. To add to the movie the screenplay supplement with the use of appendixes in The Lord of the Rings, some elements of the Unfinished Tales collection of short stories and the filmmakers own creative license. Tauriel is an original character created solely for the movie and Legolas had no role in the timeline. The events in Lake-town were also greatly altered from the original novel.\u000a\u000aUnlike previous entries in the Lord of the Rings series The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the first time we look at the North of Middle-Earth. The tensions and policies are explored and showing that the Elf kingdom is insular and does not want to get involved with the wider world and the people of Lake-town are divided. Anti-dwarf prejudice is touched on, as dwarfs are seem as greedy, selfish and short-sighted and only one level above Orcs.\u000a\u000aOne of the big themes is greed and lust; both for wealth and power. There is physical manifestation with Bilbo starting to see himself and savagely killing a spider, the Master of Lake Town seeking wealth and power, leading to the mismanagement of the town, Smaug not wanting to give up any his ill gotten gains. Thorin also suffers from greed, which affect his judgement, his relationships with his comrades and is forewarned that he could end up like his grandfather.\u000a\u000aThere is plenty of energy in the movie's action sequences, the highlight being the river chase as the Orcs, Dwarfs and Elves are in a battle, filled with decapitations and arrows to Orcs' heads. Both Legolas and Tauriel are given plenty of chances to show their action credentials, though since this is a prequel we know that Legolas is immune from any perky incidents like an axe to the head. The final battle with Smaug is also ramped up from the book, giving Bilbo and the Dwarfs a larger role.\u000a\u000aThe first act and the third act are great with its pacing, action and character development. Its the middle of the movie that The Desolation of Smaug slows down, a little too much. This is the case of the events in Lake-town as the Dwarfs try to prepare for the final leg of their journey. It is at this point when Bilbo does not have much of a presence in his own movie.\u000a\u000aThe Dwarfs are give more chance to shine this time role. In the first Hobbit movie, Ken Stott and James Nesbit were the Dwarfs with the most screen time: in the sequel Graham McTavish as Dwalin was more noticeable with his aggression, Kili is given a background and even the silent Bombur (Stephen Hunter) is shown to be very strong despite his weight problem.\u000a\u000aThe Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug will give fans their Middle-Earth and is successful at solving some of the issues of the first Hobbit movie. The tone is darker and the action is much less cartoony. The Hobbit is proof of being the pinnacle of the fantasy genre and this second film still proves that.\u000a\u000aPlease visit www.entertainmentfuse.com

VThe hobbit movies were always destined to be compared with the Lord of the Rings movies. It's a very tough act to follow and regrettably they are not living up to the Rings movies.\u000a\u000aMartin Freeman is good in the role of Bilbo, but the plot is a bit all over the place. There are battles every few minutes, but the character development which was so well done in the Rings is largely overlooked in the Hobbit. Consequently the battle scenes which are well done contain very little in the way of emotional involvement. You really don't care that much who wins and loses. It feels like Peter Jackson as got too concerned with the look of the film and forgot a little about the plot!

VThe first face one sees in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is neither Bilbo's nor Thorin's nor Gandalf's, but director Peter Jackson's, munching a carrot and peeking from the dark streets of Bree directly into the camera. The sight of him jolted me right out of Middle Earth. It was as if the film had started with Jackson cavorting centre screen in jester's guise, bellowing, "Gotcha, sucker!".\u000a\u000aAnd the more I think about this film, the more I feel I've been had. Jackson's Middle Earth cycle has plummeted from the epic high fantasy of The Two Towers to, in Desolation, cartoonery and schmaltz. The action scenes are neither spectacular nor exciting; most are simply silly, flouting the laws of physics and full of the tedious gyrations of Jackson's Indestructible Ninja Elves. (How many consecutive kill shots can you count?) The few attempts at interpersonal communication attempted by the screenplay are drowned by the soundtrack; the musical themes that were apt in Fellowship now seem so overwrought and familiar that they have become parodies of themselves.\u000a\u000aNot that the screenplay needed much help to, well, suck. I do not care whether Jackson alters or pads Tolkein's source material. But I do care (at least £25 worth, which is what I paid to see this movie in Odeon's over-hyped "iSense" high-frame rate 3D), that Jackson's liberties are so frequently implausible. I just do not buy, for example, that the wary elves of Mirkwood allowed platoons of orcs (judging by the number of them dispatched by the aforementioned Ninja Elves during the fatuous barrel-riding sequence) to pass within spitting distance of their front door, then cross the forest undetected to launch a surprise attack on the elves' river gate.\u000a\u000aAnd a "morgul shaft"? Really, Peter? Used by an orc? It's bad enough that you're repeating yourself with the whole back-lit she-elf morgul-healer thing. But at least come up with a reason for it that makes sense, instead of simply parroting Tolkeinisms from Fellowship that, apparently, you never really understood. Orcs are the donkey's asses of the evil army. I presume you know this, Peter, as the orcs in Desolation (with, perhaps, two exceptions) exist only to commit gleeful and pointless suicide upon the weapon of any available adversary. Orcs do not casually spray about any sort of rare and powerful magic arrow, let alone anything "morgul". The Witch King, so degraded, must be mad as hell.\u000a\u000aThere are some good things. The moment when Smaug's hoard slides away from beneath Bilbo's feet to reveal the dragon's eye is the best in the movie, and Smaug is easily the best movie dragon to date. But flaws infect even these good things. Smaug's hoard is suspiciously homogeneous, as if it were not accumulated but instead manifested whole from piles of digitally cloned gold coins. (Ahem.) And Smaug proves to be totally combat ineffective: The dragon goes nuclear on Thorin and company, yet fails to so much as singe a single dwarven beard.\u000a\u000aPerhaps Smaug's martial impotence reflects the film as a whole. For all its frenzy, bombast and fire, one can only roll one's eyes, and hope they do better next time.

VA hardcore Tolkien fan (as in read all of the HoME!) for some twenty years, I have an uneasy relationships with Peter Jackson's films based on Tolkien's works. While I did not like the Lord of the Rings movies for straying from the books while still pretending to be faithful to them, I loved the first Hobbit film for being a fun adventure movie that did not even pretend to follow its literary source. It was not perfect, but it grabbed and held attention enough for me to overlook its flaws.\u000a\u000aThe Desolation of Smaug felt... like a high schooler's standard pattern essay transferred to the big screen. I had two problems with it. The first one is that action sequences were too long and repetitive, to the point of being boring (and I generally like pure action movies!). I would cut each major action sequence in half... The second one is how predictable it is. Here is an exposition tying this moment to what's coming next, there is a direct quote from the LotR movies, here is some other way to tie it to LotR... I don't like being force-fed information in such an obvious fashion, though some people apparently found all the tie-ins to LotR endearing...\u000a\u000aAn interesting thing was, right after I walked out of the theater, I though it was a pretty good and entertaining movie, then I started to mostly focus on the flaws. A week later I saw it again for the "final" opinion - and again, sitting in the theater during the movie I thought that perhaps I was unfair to the movie and it is actually pretty good... but then the next day I could not remember any positives, only the flaws.\u000a\u000aTo me it felt... insubstantial. A cinematic pulp fiction of sorts...\u000a\u000aI think if I were a 10-12 year old boy who has not read Tolkien but watched LotR movies, I would have absolutely loved it. But I am none of those things, which is why I give it 4/10. Maybe would have given it 6/10 when just walking out of the movie...\u000a\u000aThis will be the first Middle-earth movie that I will not be buying in a theatrical version on DVD since I highly doubt I will want to see it again until the extended edition comes out. It is so boring that I don't even want to discuss it online, like I did with the LotR movies... it took me a month to decide to write this review after all...

Vjackson has turned the entire hobbit story into a chase scene. the hobbit story had many entertaining scenes that involve word play and other devices. for example, in the story, when bilbo is noticed by smaug, he creates riddles to put him off from the truth. in the movie, they make Smaug omniscient, and the whole scene is reduced to yet another chase scene. \u000a\u000aAlso, it was a bad idea to add the extraneous material about the coming invasion of mordor. After LOTR, it made sense for Tolkien to add this material in references later. but inserted inside the hobbit story, it just slows down, and muddles the story. I think jackson has shown he is a hack, and many of his decisions were made to maximize profits. I won't be seeing the last of this "trilogy".

VThere really aren't three films in this book they're really dragging this out now. And wait lets do a George Lucus and put characters from the original trilogy who aren't in this book into the film. Yeah that'll work oh sh*t no it doesn't. Same voices on the spiders as were on the trolls in the first film that we the same voices in return of the king yawn yawn yawn the first trilogy was watchable once but doesn't have any repeat appeal and so far the telling of this trilogy is drawn like butter scrapped over too much bread (see what I did there). Making this book into three films is just out and out greed movie studios are going the same way as game companies producing the same old sh*t over and over and hoping no ones paying attention. WERE GETTING BORED OF YOU CHEATING SOB's and soon we will start to vote with out money!!!! (Sadly the film companies know as well as I do that the masses out there will keep coming back for more no matter what crap they produce. I hope people come to their collective senses and stop going the movie theatres to see this mundane crap

VThis is the first review I have written for IMDb, I couldn't sit silently after last night's film experience...\u000a\u000aI was appalled at the liberties taken by the screenwriters. I understand why: it was a great financial idea to add back story and characters that would stretch this endeavor into an audience inclusive three part cash cow.\u000a\u000aWhat I couldn't understand is why I couldn't identify more than 10 minutes out of 160 that actually matched Tolkein's story. \u000a\u000aBeorn, The Spiders, The Elves of Mirkwood, Laketown, The Lonely Mountain - not a single scene filmed as written. I have seen truer adaptations of The Hobbit performed by children at local community centers. \u000a\u000aThe special effects are spectacular - but I can say that about dozens of movies that didn't have to rape a well loved piece of literature to make it to the screen.\u000a\u000aThe only reason I didn't walk out of this film is that I went with my wife and friends.

VAfter the disappointing first entry in the new trilogy -- which should been titled "Everything you Ever Wanted to Know About A Hobbitt's Larder, and shown on the Cooking Channel -- Jackson reminds us he is the man who, after all, did Lord of the Rings. Part II is everything Part 1 was not -- a non-stop adventure that compares with the best rides at Disneyworld, especially in 3D. The barrel scene is unforgettable. Smaug clearly has Shakespearean training -- a very educated dragon, he -- and Cumberbatch does a better job here than in Star Trek; Ian McKellen was born to play Gandolf, there is no makeup on earth than can substitute for a face with life experience. This was an almost perfect film, save for the last 60 seconds, when they essentially advertise the next instalment. In 3D raindrops are as big as bees and bees as big as raindrops. And, no charge, a love story too. Wow.

VI went to see the 48 FPS / HFR version of this film. I generally arrive at the cinema 10 minutes or so after showtime, to minimize the adverts I need to sit through before the film. When I arrived on this occasion, though, I found the film had already started. I figured I couldn't have missed much, took a seat as quietly as possible, and began watching. It was clear, however, that the plot was already well-developed, and making reference to past events that I'd missed. I missed the first film in this trilogy when it was released last year, so I thought perhaps the gaps I was noticing were down to that. However, I quickly realised that even that couldn't account for the way the film felt as if it was in its third act. So, after watching for about ten minutes or so, I popped outside again to check I was in the correct showing. Sure enough, I had been in a showing of the 24 FPS version that had started about two hours earlier.\u000a\u000aI mention the above anecdote because when I eventually made my way into the right theatre and began watching the 'correct' 48 FPS version (from the beginning this time!), it was immediately apparent that it was a very different film to the one I had been watching in the room next door. I've read a bit since my viewing, and found that there was a lot of opinion in the blogosphere that reflects the reaction I had. So, anyone that's also read the general consensus of opinion that's out there from ordinary filmgoers like me can probably guess what's coming next.\u000a\u000aThe film looked, for want of a better word, cheap. It looked like it had been made for TV. The sets looked like sets. The CGI looked like CGI. Whenever there was an outside scene, it was readily apparent that there were two light sources in them, and one of them was artificial. The main leads looked like that guy from the British version of The Office and the one from Spooks, sporting obvious makeup and prosthetics, and wearing silly wigs. \u000a\u000aI'm not an out-and-out film geek, and I undoubtedly don't know as much about film-making as does Peter Jackson. But I am someone that loved The Hobbit as one of the first books I read as a child, and I am a huge fan of Jackson's original LOTR trilogy from 2001-2003. I'm also - bear with me here - a former psychology student and have a particular interest in the subject of hypnotism; it's always struck me how great film-making is one of the subtler forms of day-to-day hypnotism to which most people can relate. Film makers and fans talk about the so-called "suspension of disbelief" that's necessary for a great storyteller to tell an engaging story to an interested audience. It requires skill and willingness from each of the parties to the process for the magic to work. Part of the reason that I think the slower frame rate worked so well is that it allowed room for a willing audience's brains to fill in unseen details. Just like a dream feels realistic in the moment, but afterwards is clearly only a mere fuzzy representation of the experienced narrative, so too 24 FPS feels like a way of communicating the intent of the story whilst leaving subtler details to the imagination.\u000a\u000aBecause so little was left to the viewer's mind's eye, The Desolation of Smaug felt like watching a reasonable amateur dramatics production. But one where you'd made the mistake of sitting too close to the stage and could therefore see the men in black clothing moving the sets around, and could perceive that the 'snow' was really tissue paper. It felt a lot like watching a BBC TV production from the 1970s or early 1980s. Specifically, I Claudius and Doctor Who sprung to mind as being reminiscent of this experience. It's not that those earlier productions were bad for their era or genres, it's just that they're not *film*, and they're not what I was expecting to see from the latest in cinema technology in late 2013. \u000a\u000aIn terms of the CGI, this film reminded me of the type of CGI you used to get in 1990s cinema. Say, for example, in Terminator 2. Which at the time was the best we had, but looking back definitely feels a bit dated compared to the photo-realistic CGI that's common in non-HFR movies now. In HFR it's crystal-clear what is CGI and what is not, whilst in ordinary 24 FPS it can sometimes be hard to tell. (E.g., quick fact: the bullet holes in the police cars during the 'nun' bank heist scene in The Town were added subtly via CGI in post-production, which I didn't notice when watching the actual film, even though it makes sense given how close some of the pyrotechnics that might otherwise have been used would have needed to be to the stunt performers).\u000a\u000aIn short, HFR may be a good medium for showing actual reality. But at this point in time, it's not good for films involving fantasy elements that require prosthetics or makeup. And CGI has to make a further leap forward before it's good enough to be indistinguishable from (HFR) reality again.

VI have sad about its. Nobody already expects its like to be original lord of the rings series but first movie was gave us a hope that it can be good with its own style. But it was disappointment. I wish to scene writers should think about "that Talkien guy can be more creative from them". Instead of it they should were preferred to write another story and add it to the hobbit without of thinking integration with whole story. \u000a\u000aThere is lots of scenes those not integrated with story. And if it isn't 3D should be better. Fast scenes looked like low FPS PC games or cartoons those children draw to bottom of their notes to me. I want to see blue-ray maybe i can think that as a different movie than.\u000a\u000aIf they will shot 3rd movie they will decide target audience. If its try the hug twilight teens and LOTR people together people will bash them from head. First of all Elven-Dwarven love is laughable and more than it disgusting. Its says to us "whole movie like if we add some romance, some comedy and at least expensive meaningless special effects gives us "monies"".

V... and it is clear that Peter Jackson loves his source material so much that the results are to the detriment of resulting movie. \u000a\u000aIn his effort to fill out every character and event with a detailed back story and extensive history, he has completely lost that magical and paradoxical combination of fairytale simplicity and deep profundity that made Tolkein's book a classic (and such a satisfying set up for the epic Lord of the Rings that followed). Instead, we tries to tell THIS story on an epic scale, and The Hobbit got lost somewhere in the process.\u000a\u000aThe other problem with over-extending the story on such a bloated scale is more basic. It is now a play in three acts ... three mammoth acts of 2-3 hours each, with intermissions of a year or more between each act. \u000a\u000aAct One was all exposition. It isn't really until this movie (Act Two) that you begin to provide the true basis of drama: conflict and suspense. And the results are better than in the first movie ... but ultimately disappointing. 160 minutes spent at a breakneck pace to create complications and difficulties for every character and subplot ... NONE of which are brought to dramatic resolution. It is all tease, no pay off. All cliff hanger. For that, we will have to wait ANOTHER year for part three.

VI can't believe I spent $18.00 (ticket, coke, popcorn) to see this crap. Way too much dialog and way too little action. And as with all of the LOR (Lord of the Rings) type movies your left hanging at the end. Well unless I have a choice of a lobotomy or seeing the next chapter, I thinks a lobotomy will be my choice. And the warning on this movie should be "ONLY WATCH IF YOUR EXTREMELY BORED"!!! Maybe a discount on the tickets of snacks would entice people to see it but I wouldn't recommend it. So between the movie previews about the new godzilla movie and the over salted and over buttered popcorn my experience was almost a complete waste of my afternoon.

VTo be honest, I have not watched any of the LOTR movies or the first part of Hobbit nor have read J R Toklen, he must be good as all the LOTRs are box office success. But for people like me, who just wanted to be entertained, this is certainly not the movie. There was so much hype, so thought, why not try. I, of course, couldn't make sense of it, and fell asleep after 30 mins or so, woke up don't know when, a man was ferrying midgets in a boat hidden in tubs of fish. I decided to walk out. So for people who haven't seen any of the movies previously, don't watch it. Enjoy the Disney movie, Frozen, not the best from Disney by a long shot, still watchable.

VOverall, I liked An Unexpected Journey much less than the original Lord of the Rings movies, which were, to be fair, fantastic. This second installment began promisingly, but it declined quickly, and had the same serious issues that the first did. \u000a\u000aThere are pluses to this film, and I want to acknowledge them. Mirkwood was well done, and although I initially criticized the use of CGI for a forest, it in fact helped create the atmosphere of the forest. The midbending element of the forest's magic was a very interesting addition, and the spiders were great. The character Bard was a very good addition as well, and provided a much better protagonist than the greedy and arrogant Thorin. Laketown was well done and just as I imagined it. Erebor and Smaug were both well portrayed. \u000a\u000aHowever, The Desolation of Smaug had difficulty, like the first, establishing what sort of mood and tone to set. It jumps from dark shots of the carcasses of slain dwarfs in Erebor to scenes of Disney-like battle choreography. The fight scenes in this film tend to be much goofier but also significantly more graphic and violent. In Mirkwood, there is a "funny" scene where the dwarfs gather around a spider and pull its legs off. Another time, an orc is catapulted up to a balcony, which provides a humorous setup, but Legolas follows up with a disgusting beheading that left an uncomfortable silence in the theater. Peter Jackson can't seem to reconcile the silliness of the children's book and the darkness he established in Lord of the Rings.\u000a\u000aPeter Jackson also utilizes the same sort of situations that appear in Lord of the Rings and bring into question his versatility and originality as a writer. There are far too many times when one of the characters (whose voices are without exception deep and somber) will look into the distance and say something like "darkness is growing" or "there is yet hope." These meaningless clichés are thrown around so frequently that there is little time left for meaningful dialogue. The script hits rock bottom when someone says to Thorin, "the dragon will kill you," and Thorin replies, ever so articulately and cleverly, "not if I kill it first." Jackson's main antagonist through most of the film is, yet again, Sauron, and new characters always warn the company about the growing threat of the Necromancer. It begins to sound tiresomely like the Lord of the Rings all over again. There are numerous other instances of repeated conflicts and character archetypes like the "it is not our fight" argument between races, the conniving, deceitful king's adviser, the character who nearly dies in combat but watches, in slow motion and in silence, someone come to their aid, the shot of a character climbing over yet another enormous ancient statue engraved into a mountain (the Secret Doorway my ass), etc.\u000a\u000aA serious issue is the character Kili and his love situation with Tauriel. Kili becomes important in this film, and in fact becomes the object of affection of the new strong female character Tauriel. I do not object to the introduction of Tauriel - the story is undoubtedly dominated by men, but Tauriel's love for Kili is laughable. There is no believability or emotion there, and when Kili is poisoned by a Morgul blade (sound familiar? Apparently they are not so rare), no one cares. And no one in the audience cares to see the action of the climax interrupted by scenes of her healing him.\u000a\u000aThere are multiple other instances of nonsense and stupidity in the editing and writing of this film, but they are too numerous to list here. Instead I will detail to you the Desolation of Peter Jackson upon Smaug.\u000a\u000aThe movie begins to careen off of the tracks about five minutes after Bilbo enters the Lonely Mountain, and it crashes and burns in the final minutes. Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch both performed very well together, as Biblo desperately tries to flatter the probing and arrogant Smaug into letting him live. But then Peter Jackson took some creative liberties with the story that ultimately made no sense and destroyed the film. The dwarfs enter too, and they lead Smaug on a merry goose-chase, and the dragon is apparently incapable of keeping track of more than one group of dwarfs. It is embarrassing and stomach- churning to watch Smaug bumble after the scurrying dwarfs. When they finally lead Smaug down to the forges (where they obviously have the best chance of escape), they trick him into lighting them, and they pour molten gold into carven rivulets. The dragon is still struggling to detain his pesky intruders, when he finally corners Bilbo and several of the dwarfs at the end of a hall. But they're standing on some large stone structure, which they tear apart to reveal an enormous cast gold statue of a dwarf. Smaug gazes at it greedily, but then the eye of the dwarf pops out and the statue melts and Smaug nearly drowns in the boiling metal. This bizarre and completely senseless ending put the nail in the coffin of this hopeless movie. And it was the last thing that happened before the abrupt ending, which cuts the movie with a "what have we done?" by poor little Bilbo. Right, you are, Bilbo.

VI am a keen fan of Tolkien's books and when I was told this film was better than the previous one, I was excited for it. However both me and my girlfriend were extremely disappointed. What started out looking like quite a good film turned into one that had me looking at my watch and shaking my head wondering where on earth things were going.\u000a\u000aThe story starts how it ended - with our heroes being chased by a make believe Orc pack led by a guy who isn't even alive in the books. Okay, it makes things a bit more interesting I suppose. It turns the book from a quest into a chase. \u000a\u000aThe scene in the woods was very good, and true to the book for a change. The exit in the barrels was entertaining, despite the regenerating Orc pack and barrels (that Bombur manages to roll into despite previously crushing his own barrel). Although the side quest with the elves doesn't exist in the book, I can see why Jackson did it. Although the silly love triangle with the female elf and Kili makes little sense. \u000a\u000aThe film started to go wrong after Bilbo entered the mountain. The scene with Smaug was entertaining but it just went completely off the rails, it was almost laughable at times. Even for someone who hadn't read the books you could clearly point out everything that didn't even make sense. Why was Bilbo allowed to freely stand in front of the dragon without his ring on? Why did the dwarfs then enter the mountain, only to run down the stairs instead of back the way they came? Why could Smaug not smell the dwarfs despite crawling directly over the top of them? Smug then stands by dwarfs at several points without thinking to crush them which he could have so easily done. In fact how all the dwarfs made it out alive is nothing short of bizarre. Then Thorin rides an iron shield down a molten lake of gold (which is highly logical) and a solid gold statue turns to liquid for no apparent reason. Then finally, hurrah, the dragon does what he should have done half an hour ago, he goes to destroy the lake town. Phew. We got there eventually, despite the most uncomfortable 30 minutes of film I've ever sat through. \u000a\u000aSeriously I do laugh at some of the reviews saying it is the film of the year. Even without reading the books you can see how utterly ridiculous some parts of the film are. It just didn't make sense most of the time. A real disappointment.

VWe all know that Jackson takes broad liberties with what Tolkien gave us and it is no where more obvious than in DOS. Since you have to expect that, it wasn't a deal breaker but if you are a Tolkien purist, hopefully you have realized that the theater and Mr. Jackson's renditions aren't for you.\u000a\u000aThere is no reason at all for the creation of Turiel other than to make the movie longer. She doesn't exist in middle earth, only in Jackson's screenplay. She really adds nothing to the story and from what Orlando's father in the movie says about her relationship with Legolas, she won't be around long. I really didn't expect her to make it through the film but it looks like we will have to put up with her in the last installment. She's more "lost" here than she was on the island. Sorry Evangeline, it's not that you were bad, your character just wasn't any good and completely unnecessary.\u000a\u000aJackson continued to alter Tolkien's world with every step he took in this film. 95% is Jackson. 5% is Tolkien. Very sad.\u000a\u000aThat being said, it was a good film. I did enjoy it, mostly. Jackson loves battle scenes. I do not. I thought it was better than the first one and I hope they will finally dump Azog completely since he was dead long before the Hobbit started. Another unforgivable alteration by Jackson. I will be glad to see the final installment next year and then rejoice in the fact that the stories have finally been done and not have to worry about them being brutalized any further. So glad that Jackson does not own the rights to the Silmarillion so he can't screw it up.

VMany call this the best Hobbit. I don't see why - it is one of the downright worst films I've ever seen. \u000a\u000aMiddle Earth is completely saturated in CGI which nearly always kills the sense of wonder that Andrew Lesnie's cinematography could create with New Zealand's natural setting. Motion capture is necessary in for creatures like Smaug and Gollum, but the decision to use it for Orcs is downright terrible because as a result none of the creatures look real. It looks like big noodles of CGI flailing around and interacting. Worse, none of the film's action has any tension because everyone slays their opponent outside of perhaps one sword clash. If you watch the best fight scenes in LOTR, they usually involve challenge, like Aragorn racing to Boromir's aid only to be slowed by random Uruk-hai warriors. Here, every character - dwarf or elf or even Bilbo - kills any person in their path. The only actual action sequences involve Legolas (who we know survives and therefore provides no tension).\u000a\u000aI'll mention some positive elements because they do exist. Martin Freeman (Bilbo), Lee Pace (Thranduil) and Luke Evans (Bard) all provide excellent performances. Freeman is clearly trying the hardest of everyone and has some wonderful moments especially whilst interacting with Smaug. The traumatised look on his face when climbing out of Bard's toilet makes the whole scene. Pace could easily be the thousand-year old King Thranduil (despite being two years younger than his on-screen son), and delivers the film's lines with almost Shakespearen grace. Evans is giving a passionate performance, and its a shame he's never allowed to interact with anyone else with talent. The visual creation of Smaug was everything I could ever hope, voiced flawlessly by Benedict Cumberbatch, and there are still some wonderful moments of cinematography.\u000a\u000aBut that's where it ends. \u000a\u000aRyan Gage's Alfrid is a cancer on the Middle Earth franchise. He contributes nothing but unnecessary conflict to pad the movie into a trilogy. Orlando Bloom is cashing in his whole performance and providing absolutely nothing to the story but inane action sequences. Even the great Ian McKellen is overacting (he does this thing with his mouth after he speaks) and that's truly sad. Ironically, Sir Anthony Sher probably gives the best performance of all the dwarfs and his scenes exist only in the Extended Edition.\u000a\u000aThe screenplay is disgusting, full of quarter-baked story lines (ahem, Tauriel-Kili), undeveloped characters (Legolas), and truly heinous dialogue ("I told him to go ishkh khakfe andu null!", "I could have anything down my trousers"). Characters make stupid declarations about danger that we know won't come true but are included to pad the run time. Azog continues to be an underdeveloped villain - especially with the introduction of Bolg - and his purpose is only to harass Gandalf (again, a character we know will live through the film). \u000a\u000aThe film's big set pieces are both enormously undercut by different elements. The barrel ride is ruined by the Legolas jumping on Orc heads and also by the forced romance - Tauriel is so undeveloped with Kili that its almost distracting how much she appears to care. The "morgul shaft" is a gimmick included for no other reason than to further a barely functioning love story - the orc's taunting of Tauriel makes no sense without the context that he isn't aware of. The big fight scene with Smaug is undercut by logical implausibilities (riding on molten gold) and the fact that the film ends so abruptly and unnecessarily. Couldn't they have just taken the death of Smaug from the start of the third Hobbit and ended the film on that?\u000a\u000aI could go on for hours about how terrible this film is, but I'll just finish with two things that bother me. First, Azog just walks in and talks to Sauron. Orcs don't walk in and talk to Sauron. Gothmog talked to the Witch-King and he was the general in charge of 200,000 orcs sacking Minas Tirith. Azog is just some big orc. It is like a big storm trooper talking to the Emperor. \u000a\u000aSecondly, there's too much CGI gold. If the dwarfs literally liberated that gold and brought it back into the economy it would have no value whatsoever. If you physically make Minas Tirith and everything in it out of gold, then there's no point in buying anything! I feel that the CGI department should have just calmed right down. Some have accused me of nitpicking, but honestly either this is a pressing issue or the movie is so boring that it gave me nothing else to think about.

VAfter being somewhat let down by the first Hobbit film, I was still somewhat interested in seeing Smaug in the second. It's not every day you see a wonderfully arrogant British dragon talking down to others. As expected, Smaug is the highlight, while the rest of the film is hampered by the same issues that held the first outing back.\u000a\u000aWe pick up where we left off, with Gandalf, Bilbo and the dwarfs on the road to Erebor in order to reclaim it from Smaug. On the way, they split up, with Gandalf heading to Dol Guldur and the dwarfs entering Mirkwood, a forest filled with huge spiders. They narrowly escape, but are captured by elves, including a familiar face (Legolas) and a new one (Tauriel). They are brought before Legolas's father, the king Thranduil. Naturally, with tensions between dwarfs and elves always being high, this 'meeting' goes less than well. Thorin remembers very well how the elves refused to help when they were driven out of Erebor by Smaug. Meanwhile, the dwarf Kili and the elf Tauriel develop something of a romance, further complicating matters. Bilbo, using the ring, helps the dwarfs escape using empty wine barrels and floating down the river. Legolas and Tauriel give chase, but are forced to aid the dwarfs when orcs show up. After a somewhat boring sequence involving Lake-Town, Bilbo and the rest (excluding a now wounded Kili) resume their march toward Erebor wondering, like me, if they'll find something worth paying an admission ticket for.\u000a\u000aAnd they do find it, more or less, in the form of Smaug, a deliciously cocky dragon voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. It's the kind of villain where you relish every line he utters. It's all very quotable. Unfortunately, even if you haven't read the book (like me), you immediately know that Smaug's pride and arrogance will prove to be his downfall. The only thing left to do then is cherish the scenes where he mocks the protagonists, etc. A scene I really like is when Thorin and the rest lay a trap for Smaug. Thorin lures him by (what else?) insulting him and claims how they'll have their revenge. I won't tell you what the trap entails, but needless to say, it doesn't work and Smaug consequently mocks the notion that they could have their revenge: "Revenge? Revenge!? I will show you revenge!" It's hard to put into words, but it's one of Smaug's more badass moments.\u000a\u000aSo Smaug is fun to watch, but the rest of the film is either boring, suffers from uninteresting storytelling and dialogue or features poor CGI. A lot of the action scenes, like the river chase, just don't look good. It really feels like 90% of the budget went into Smaug. This effect is only increased by the over-the-top choreography. Whenever Legolas is fighting, he jumps, he slides, he flips and he just looks blurry. The same goes for the attempts to inject the action with humor, like when Bombur (the fat one) pirouettes in one of the barrels with his axes sticking out, thus killing any approaching orcs. Though funny, it also reduces the tension drastically. The romance between Kili and Tauriel was also uninvolving. Rather than feeling for them, it felt like the requisite romance, like Aragorn and Arwen in the original trilogy. But maybe it'll pay off in the third film. Another wasted opportunity is Beorn, the 'skin-changer' who shelters Gandalf and the rest at the beginning of the film. He has his monologue about how orcs killed his kind and how he's the last one, but I'm just rolling my eyes thinking 'who cares?' Reading the book would've probably helped when relating to him, but that's just an excuse. The film itself has to be capable of at least making you sympathize with him. As it is, Beorn just feels like a throwaway character. Lake-Town is also uninteresting. Not only does Stephen Fry in the role of the mayor feel incredibly out of place, it's all just really unengaging, a problem exacerbated by little things that don't make sense. So, you're trying to sneak out of Lake-Town with a whole bunch of stolen swords and you're letting Kili, who's injured by an arrow to the leg, carry the swords? Well, gee, I hope he doesn't trip or anyth—oh wait, he just fell down and the racket caused by the swords has woken up all of Lake-Town. Well done, guys…well done.\u000a\u000aProblems, problems… It's interesting looking back on these two films and seeing how much they differ from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Of course, the scale is smaller overall, but they just 'feel' different, in the same way that the Star Wars prequel trilogy feels different and that's not a good thing. You know it's bad when you're looking at the trailer for The Battle of the Five Armies and all you're really thinking is 'let's just get it over with'.

VHow can a film like this be boring? I love the previous four films (yes, four, since the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is so clearly connected to this), so what possibly could go wrong? Is it conceivable that I try harder to be 'critical' now that I'm writing about these things I love? Sure. Is it also conceivable that the bubble finally burst, and Peter Jackson delivered a bloated, plodding, nearly joyless Middle Earth film that actually feels three hours long before we even meet the marvelous titular character? Absolutely.\u000a\u000aUp to this point, these 'creatively adapted' four films have given us visual splendors as well as soulful performances. Jackson and crew have no equals as it pertains to technical brilliance, and they have such an outward passion for the material that it has shown on- screen. His indie sensibilities paired with his keen eye for 'dirty worlds' have been a natural fit for J.R.R.Tolkein's material, and I do not believe there is another filmmaker working today who could have come close to what he's accomplished.\u000a\u000aSo, what is "The Desolation of Smaug" missing? To begin with, it lacks the sincerity and heart of the previous films. Perhaps it's the lack of whimsical, wispy musical overtures like the 'Shire' theme. Perhaps it's the lack of hobbits in general. Perhaps it's the newfound toy Bilbo has that draws his darker side out. Perhaps it's a creative choice to show all, or most of the main characters allowing their negative traits to shine through, leading them on dangerous paths. By themselves, all of these reasons would be solid markers to prove the lack of heart in the film, but together it snowballs into an unenjoyable conglomeration of CGI set pieces and choreographed battles.\u000a\u000aEven the lightest part of the film involving the elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) had no resonance once I learned that she was a completely fabricated character. I made a point not to read The Hobbit, as I figured that three films totaling 8 hours would probably provide all the narrative I needed. Finding out after the film that Tauriel was invented for this film was disheartening- after all, if Tolkein's work alone, and Jackson's prowess aren't enough, why would we be interested? I think the answer lies in a cynical place- Tauriel exists to soften the edges, to attract more females to a film with a predominantly male cast, and mostly, to bring in more money.\u000a\u000aThus far, Jackson has been able to deftly navigate the muddied waters of studio interests, rights issues, fanboys, and casual viewers. Choosing to include a character not previously established, combined with the need to stretch this material into three films, disappoints me. I guarantee it has been difficult for Jackson to satisfy everyone, but I cannot deny the negativity that has now gathered around what had been a relatively pure experience for me. Call me naive, but that's where I stand.\u000a\u000aIf there is one thing that works extremely well, it's certainly the realization of the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) on-screen. If Smaug were in the rest of the film, I'd have to reconsider my overall opinion. Sadly, he's only part of roughly 45 minutes, and it's clearly the high-water mark for the film. Smaug's slithering, booming voice strikes an excellent balance as he exchanges witty repartee with Bilbo, and his movements are so cool yet menacing that I can't help but think of him as one of the better 'villains' of recent age. It should come as no surprise that he's the best dragon we've ever seen in movies, with respect to Draco of "Dragonheart", and the Hungarian Horntail of "Harry Potter" fame.\u000a\u000aI imagine that the last entry for Middle Earth, next year's "There and Back Again" will be a better film than this. One can only hope that Jackson has remembered what made these films the experiences they are as he finishes the editing process- they are deeply rooted, beautiful to look at, and strong with emotion and heart. The first two things are abundant in "The Desolation of Smaug", but the heart is sorely lacking, turning this into an exercise in action choreography and CGI set pieces, nearly redeemed by a scaly talking monster.

VTo have taken the Preeminent Fantasy story and hacked it up with additions of ridiculous things like an elf love story, dwarf/dragon action sequence was horrific. It is understood to summarize the story and cut off many parts but leave the main thread of the story. It is understood to take small, reasonable liberties with elements and creative license.\u000a\u000aThe entire dwarve dragon action sequence in the end was a detestable joke. I haven't bought this movie because it is so horribly distorted. The addition of Tauren and a love story to the story is as ridiculous.\u000a\u000aInstead of becoming one of the greatest magical stories every told you've have hacked it up and maimed it. It is as forgettable as the cartoon hobbit. Absolutely Tragic. Mr Jackson needs to hang up his hat.

VThese films were initially shot in New Zealand. I wonder if it was more to pay a 'homage' to a country that boasts the largest cinema screen in the world rather than for the scenery- Scotland & England are interesting from landscape point of view and would have been more appropriate since the Tolkien books were written in England, not New Zealand. I read three JR Tolkien books when I was young and much of whats in this film I didn't recognize-maybe I forgot it-maybe it wasn't even there. The film was forgettable in the true sense of the word- as in the scene with the dragon is so bad you will do pretty much anything to forget it-go on a week long drunk-watch 25 007 movies in a row-that type of thing. The only positive reviews I have seen for what amounts to an abundance of less than amazing films these days seem to come from New Zealand-home of the worlds biggest cinema screen-and the place where director Peter Jackson decided to shoot much of the footage for these so called screen adaptations of a decidedly wordy story for kids & adolescents written in the 1930's-that foreshadowed WW2-but that little tidbit can't be mentioned by Peter Jackson. Guess you saw that coming & I really should have seen this film coming also-it was predictably overblown and did little to enlighten the viewers as the the reasoning behind the troubles in Middle Earth. I still haven't got a clue-something about a ring-that nobody wants & a bunch of wizards that nobody can remember the names of. File under Unicorns.

VI love the hobbit and was looking forward to seeing this movie. I was so disappointed. I kept watching my watch hoping it was over. If I had not gone with a group, I would have walked out. It was all action and no substance. I did not care about the characters at all and this is coming from someone who has read the book several times. It was all action all the time to the detriment of it even having a point. I guess if that is all you want you will like it, but if you like a good story to go with all the action be prepared to be disappointed. It does not stay true to the wonderful book either. There was lots of pointless things added just so there could be more action and killing and...........This was a big waste of time!

VThe first film; well I quite liked it as it captured the feel and themes of the book really well, albeit so drawn out you would think that the series would go for 5 films.\u000a\u000aNow, the second in the series. Things change a lot and the pace hits absolute top gear, flying from one encounter to the next.\u000a\u000aOverall the film did not work for me. I know some will lap up the action, but it is unnecessarily drawn out, action scenes are even added where there should not be and did not happen in the book; but all this comes at the expense of the character development and building of the grandeur, length and epicness of the adventure. With three films to work with, there is an opportunity to spend some time doing this, however, with the distracting side plots and drawn out action scenes, there is no time.\u000a\u000aWhat made the LOTR series great was the ability to capture the themes and story of the books. For the hobbit, I'm starting to feel its not the hobbit any more, just a movie with characters of the same name.\u000a\u000aFight scene with smaug at the end never happened in the book and ended up just stupid. Rivers of gold and a liquified gold titan whipped up in a few minutes....really?

VThis movie is OK if you like 2 hr 40 min of sturm and drang. Scenery and special effects are good, and the movie is visually appealing. Much of the action was clearly driven by the 3-D format. However, any resemblance to the book is superficial at best. In essence, the title has been grafted onto a mostly different story. Anyone expecting a faithful recounting will be sorely disappointed. Based on the examples so far, it must be almost impossible to write a screenplay accurately derived from Tolkien's stories, or one that captures their grace and lyrical charm. Though this series of movies has been a modest commercial success, I suspect Tolkien would be aghast at Peter Jackson's work.

VI did not give it awful because the dragon was really quite good. The problem with this series is that Jackson has fallen into the trap of making money before passion for his art. That is OK in itself as most film makers do exactly the same and always have and always will but why does he do it? Good question. I mean he has enough cash does he not? He has enough fame does he not? So why? Well, because ultimately he was never really been a hero of film making at all. Disguised in his hobbit cloak he tricked almost everybody into believing the garbage he was saying but now we all know where his true allegiance lies. In the gold at the bottom of the mountain. The ring has him firmly in its grasp and such a shame too. Will not be supporting any further of his ventures and I will never forgive him for selling out to the true Tolkien spirit. Should have made one good film and end it there but NO. Sequels mean cash and so it is as it has always been. The mind of man summed up in a travesty of deceit.

VThis film continues the story of "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" and, in my opinion, is the worse of the two. The length of the film as a whole, at 2 hours and 41 minutes, isn't the problem. The problem is that the ending drags on for 40 minutes and is ultimately bare and dismal.\u000a\u000aThe score, though average for the beginning of the film, is ineffective for the later part. For a film like this you need an eruptive and explosive score, and in this we are lacking.\u000a\u000aThe acting here is much better and more believable than it's predecessor, though Richard Armitige's (Thorin Oakenshield) performance could still be improved.\u000a\u000aUnlike in "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," the size proportions of the Hobbits, Dwarfs etc. are a constant, which improves the believability overall. Similarly, the graphics are slightly improved here which, again, improves the credibility.\u000a\u000aThe battle scenes - especially the scene at the river - are beautifully orchestrated and easy to follow. That quality is of the greatest importance in an action film; and this film has more than it's fair share of action.\u000a\u000aThe gore is kept to a minimum, but there are far more beheadings than one would think necessary. It does, however, give more substance to the battle scenes, rather than hiving just boring sword swings and arrow fire.\u000a\u000aThe dialogue could be improved in explaining the situation at hand. Like the antecedent, there are gaps of important information that I very much hope will be explained and tied up in full in the next film.

VLet me first say, I was a big fan of 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' while growing up, and have overall enjoyed the movie versions. A few things have bothered me though. I noticed these things starting with 'The Return of the King':\u000a\u000a1. Why is every battle scene a handful or few versus and endless number of enemies? I feel like I'm watching a video game and not a movie. Can't it be just a little more realistic? Maybe a few versus a few more?\u000a\u000a2. Why do most of the Dwarfs, Hobbits, Elves, etc have capped teeth? \u000a\u000a3. Why does the new female character have Hollywood lips?

VBEWARE! Spoilers Contained.\u000a\u000aThis a brief summary of my thoughts. For me the H:DOS is one of Jackson's weaker films. The film delivers as a great action, fantasy but does not contain the depth and stamina of the LOTR trilogy or the first Hobbit film, which in my opinion was just as good as LOTR. The action and CGI are far too cartooned for my liking and the plot is evidently bulked up for the sake of making the 2 film plan work as a trilogy. The story elements that are added such as the Elf, Dwarf love triangle is ridiculous and goes against the hatred between the elves and dwarfs established in H:AUJ. In my opinion the film lacks character development and drama and the inclusion of Legolas as a character adds no weight to the story and seems pointless just for the sake of linking it with LOTR. Bilbo is the one character who does go through an arc as he slowly becomes obsessed with the ring and aware of Thorin's motives Some scenes iconic to the book I feel were rushed or poorly constructed such as the barrel sequence and Beorn's house. What I would have liked from this chapter is more of Radagast's character investigating the Necromancer and being the one who is captured as opposed to Gandulf. I also felt the ending should have been the demise of Smaug rather than being saved for the final chapter. In doing so would it have been reminiscent of LOTR. In two towers the lesser evil is defeated leaving the ROTK for them to fight the main villain. Although I look forward to the Five Armies I can't help feel it will be overfilled with action.

VI am not a Tolkien fan when I write this, I am just a casual viewer of the series because, well... I have almost no knowledge of the books except they were well respected and they kind of made the transition to having fantasy stories intended for adult audiences. Well, thought the original Lord Of The Rings trilogy was overrated but I still enjoyed them and they were above average and for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. I kind of liked that but it's nothing on the originals... then there's this - the first one in all the series of which I didn't like.\u000a\u000aBilbo has continued his adventure as they draw nearer to the mountain in which the Dwarf kingdom that is rightfully theirs is. Bilbo must go in there and take back the stone in which will get the other dwarfs to join Thorin and the others to reign once again. But they all must face something together, a near-indestructible dragon by the name of Smaug.\u000a\u000aNow, before fans of this series jump all over me, I should say what I liked. Well as typical of the series, the acting is really good, The cinematography is a marvel to look at, the Art design is top of the line (well, maybe except on the Woodland Elf King... Sorry, I just couldn't take him seriously!) and the CG work in some cases out- rival the very best of the stuff today. Not to mention Smaug is definitely the best movie dragon I have seen so far.\u000a\u000aNow with something like that where does this movie fall short? The story. It might seem like I'm insulting Tolkien but I'm not. First of all, the love triangle is probably the most transparent way to drag in a female audience I've seen since Twilight, I have never read the book but even then it's so poorly woven into the story that you can tell from a mile off this isn't in there.\u000a\u000aThere are also some parts that are really stupid. I mean the first couple of minutes takes place in the Prancing Pony with Thorin and Gandalf... I don't know if they mention a time for when it takes place but the thoughts that would go through any nerd's mind (fan or not) is "wait a minute... shouldn't they be in the other direction and... a few hundred thousand miles away?" and they talk about the Orcs placing a price on Thorin's head... I repeat, in the middle of a PUBLIC BAR WHERE ANYONE CAN EAVESDROP they talk about the price on Thorin's head, shouldn't they think "What if someone in here's listening in and decides to kill Thorin and collect the money?", I know I'm nitpicking on this one scene but there is stuff like this all throughout the movie.\u000a\u000aThe very last thing I'll complain about (which it isn't a complaint on just this movie but more the entire Hobbit series) is that I know a couple of Tolkien readers and from what I've heard the book is about 300 pages long whereas this movie, combined with the first one is about 330 minutes plus another three hour movie coming out (which by my math makes it about 510 minutes). Now, the question is - How do you make a book adaptation where the book is shorter then the movies? It's a simple question.\u000a\u000aIf you want my personal opinion, the build-up for Smaug in the last movie was massive and here they really do have it pay off here. Aside from that the cinematography, art design and the acting are all worth watching this movie for. Aside from that, there are some things in the story that REALLY don't work. I mean if you like the original and want to see this movie then I guess there isn't that much harm in it. But for me personally, I'll watch The Hobbit 3 and that's as far as things'll go when it comes to me and this series.

VI would rather skip the part with the major conflict most people have about chopping the book into pieces in favour of the film, and go straight to the feeling I got while watching it. What both my wife and I felt in almost every scene, was "what the hell?" and almost anger. First of all, this is not a fantasy adventure any more, but an action movie. Legolas goes all pew pew, martial dancing, etc. etc. The film has literally action scenes. Almost no photography, no scenery, no music, and most importantly; no logic in the progression of the plot. \u000a\u000aMost scenes were extended to the limits of a nervous breakdown (e.g the barrel-river scene) and the characters/plot would got stuck for nothing, or because someone did something foolish. I mean, the whole film goes with countless "Pippins throwing stones into wells" only to have something to go on. In addition almost no major turn has any logic or reason. For example, the eagles that saved the fellowship, dropped the dwarfs just before their target on a dangerous place, when they could just as easily leave them a bit further, and to make things even worse, Gandalf abandons the fellowship before a death forrest only to go to Radagast (who does not even appear on the novel) to tell him to find Galandriel and then confront alone the strongest Ainur in existence in his own territory. \u000a\u000aOnly reason to rate this 5/10 is the novel, the (very good) SFX and a couple good photography scenes.

VI had always been admirer of "The Lord of the Rings" and watched and enjoyed all three of them many times.\u000a\u000aBut The Hobbit series had been disappointing. "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" was not up to the mark set by "The Lord of the Rings".\u000a\u000aI was expecting "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" to be better.\u000a\u000aBut this movie failed to impress again.\u000a\u000aSoul of any movie is story line, but it is missing.\u000a\u000aIt looks like the movie is created by by combining leftover shots of The Lord Of The Rings.\u000a\u000aMost of the scenes are stereotype, does not keep the audience interested.\u000a\u000aI know it takes a lot of effort and dedication to create these kind of movies, but for me as a viewer, it did not impress me as expected.

VI find it very hard to detect any trace of the rare magic that is JRR Tolkien in any of Jackson's works (with the ironic exception of Radagast's cameo appearance in An Unexpected Journey, which was never in The Hobbit). It's as if Jackson intended to write Tolkien out of the story. How could someone who has read and admired the writings of JRR Tolkien find license to alter the characters and story line in such a heavy-handed, broad and simple-minded way? It's like he can't get out of the way of the story. The very fact that Jackson's mediocre and wholesale rewrite of The Hobbit made it past the "drawing board" and all the way to the silver screen speaks to a lack of intelligence on his part and a lack of courage to those in a position to counter him.\u000a\u000aMaybe someday, someone will come along and produce/direct a verbatim film wherein the essence of Tolkien is not lost in the process. Unfortunately it may take a while for the film industry to realize that The Hobbit (as well as The Lord of the Rings) were never truly adapted to film.\u000a\u000aI sincerely hope that Peter Jackson can someday create a story (of his own) that can rise to the level of JRR Tolkien. Hopefully then he will cease to butcher the works of the great masters and discover that well-financed tenacity has nothing what-so-ever to do with talent.\u000a\u000aHowever, I am thankful that Jackson is not an astronaut, for if he were he would have surely found a way to defecate on the morning star.

VI'd say almost the whole movie was a disappointment except for the portrayal of Smaug and his enigmatic conversation with Bilbo but it bitterly becomes silly and disappointing after that again, because Smaug looks like a moron chasing the Dwarfs that long and he is not able to kill them because the dwarfs are obviously very 'quick' and 'smart' - I mean if they are that swift to dodge dragon fire, why the hell they need a burglar then? - obviously, in this installment there is no regard concerning the book, all the charming and fascinating details that made the plot unique have been removed and replaced by stupid and needless combat scenes that feel completely out of place. it doesn't feel natural at all, I mean The Hobbit deserved a much more elegant production and it could've been much more gracefully done than this stereotypical Hollywood battle movie!

VThe Hobbit is (dare I say it) precious to me. My father read it to me as a five year old each night before bed. I did the same with my oldest son when he turned five. \u000a\u000aOverall, I've been happy with the Peter Jackson adaptations. There's plenty of 'true' Tolkien included and I've been able to tolerate the changes. DoS is no different but geez Jackson is pushing the limits.\u000a\u000aThe most frustrating thing about the hobbit movies is how inept the bad guys are at killing people. What's the point of establishing big, blood thirsty, killing machines when a soft serve with a sling shot is taking them down? \u000a\u000aThis takes away all feeling of menace within the movie and makes the periods of exposition almost unbelievable. How can we invest in the thought that a goblin army invaded and overthrew Moria when thirteen dwarfs survive an attack by thousands of goblins without a scratch? One of them was brandishing a soup ladle as a weapon! The kitchen staff should have been enough to defend Moria.\u000a\u000aAt one point in DoS the dwarfs had been bitten by giant spiders, imprisoned by elves and were armour-less, weapon-less and stuck in barrels floating down a river. \u000a\u000aThen Legolas and Tauriel go tip-toeing and pirouetting across the boulders slaughtering orc after orc. Why was the last alliance of elves and men such a ferocious battle?\u000a\u000aI didn't mind the introduction of Tauriel. Imagine if she had been introduced as the surviving member of an Elvish hunting party that got decimated by orcs. It would establish her credentials and have the orcs gain some much needed credibility. \u000a\u000aAmong others LotR had Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Theoden, Theodered, Denethor die or suspected dead. Faramir and Eowyn were grievously injured, all added weight to the story that these battles had consequences. The Hobbit movies are the poorer for lacking this edge.\u000a\u000aI know I'll get howled down for this but I wouldn't have minded if Jackson had knocked off a couple of dwarfs along the way. Preferably Ori and Dori (how desperate was Thorin to have brought along those two cupcakes?) It would have rocked everyone back in their seats, given the bad guys some impetus and had us all wondering what was coming next. Would we have missed two dwarfs?\u000a\u000aBack to Tauriel. I didn't mind that there was an introduced character, I didn't mind that she was a she and I could even live with the bizarre love triangle. \u000a\u000aAre elves so superficial that Kili's eyebrow waggle, smutty double entendre and relative height were enough to get her immortal heart racing?\u000a\u000aIt was just clumsy that she was into Kili based only on his look and long before he revealed his poetic, romantic side and she'd sucked the poison out of his...(see Jackson you're not the only one).\u000a\u000aHas Elrond been waiting 800 years for Celeborn to get out of the way so he can have a crack at Galadriel?\u000a\u000aWhy was Legolas such an angry young Elf? There's parts of LotR where he is quite grim but in DoS he's like a troubled teen. It would have been nice to have visited Legolas at home but his introduction as a major character was completely unnecessary.\u000a\u000aThe handling of his hots for Tauriel was, like a lot of things, raced through.\u000a\u000aThranduil: Legolas likes you. Tauriel (breathless): Does he? But you would never allow a guy like him and a gal like me...? Thranduil: No. I wouldn't.\u000a\u000aDone. Move on.\u000a\u000aThranduil was great. He really tapped into that Elvish other worldly quality but in a distant, angry sort of a way. \u000a\u000aI've heard people unhappy with the brevity of Beorn's appearance in DoS. Beorn is a classic character but I can understand his limited involvement...all they did in the book was eat honey cakes and drink milk. I'm looking forward to seeing Beorn kicking ass in the Battle of Five Armies. \u000a\u000aLikewise the journey through Mirkwood. Jackson established the confusion and drowsiness of the forest without having the dwarfs chasing fairy lights all night. The spider battle was brief and intense but like a lot of things in these adaptations we've seen it before in LotR. \u000a\u000aWe see in Bard yet another "can he escape the shadow of his ancestors" storyline however I think the third hobbit movie will be better for his characters development given the major role he is to play. \u000a\u000aThe Dol Guldur back story is well handled and provides a link to make this series a true prequel to the LotR movies. The shot of Gandalf charging across the bridge with staff in one hand and Glamdring in the other is truly iconic.\u000a\u000aSmaug. Smaug's introduction was brilliant. The treasure horde was of a scale that couldn't be imagined and the slow reveal of the dragon was amazing. Smaug's voice and movements were perfect. The riddling with Bilbo was intense and very evocative of the book. But...we have yet another epic villain who couldn't hit the side of a barn!\u000a\u000aThe Erebor sequences of Smaug playing hide and seek with the Dwarfs were obviously intended to provide an action packed climax to part two but all they achieved was stripping yet another key villain of his power and menace.\u000a\u000aThe gold statue of Thror is one of the most ridiculous movie scenes of all time. After going to all the trouble of setting it up, Smaug simply shakes like a dog after a bath and everything is fine. \u000a\u000aAs always the landscapes and sets of Middle Earth are breath taking. The performances are very good. \u000a\u000aThe problem for mine is that Jackson seems less sure of where and how he needs to vary from the original text than previously.

VI initially rated the first Hobbit movie 6 out of 10 and this one 7. On further reflection, I was too generous; they're lucky to each get 5.\u000a\u000aThe Desolation of Smaug still has Peter Jackson's remarkable production values, and it has a bit less goofiness (the goblin king in the first movie was nauseating to watch).\u000a\u000aHowever, this film bears painfully little resemblance to the book. The filmmakers:\u000a\u000a*added a slew of characters (Tauriel the elf-woman; Legolas the elf-dude, who appears in The Lord of the Rings but not in The Hobbit; the blackhearted aide to the master of the lake town; etc.)\u000a\u000a*inflated other characters' roles (Bard ferries the dwarfs to the lake town and hides them, and he is suspected of seeking to overthrow the Master; the Elvenking is now named Thranduil and gets involved in various matters, such as Legolas's fondness for Tauriel; etc.)\u000a\u000a*reduced some of the most charming bits (the conversation as more and more dwarfs arrive at Beorn's house; various songs)\u000a\u000a*and added so much running-from-the-orcs and running-from-the-dragon footage that the story becomes more action than thought (it seems like Run Lola Run set in Middle Earth).\u000a\u000aI could go on - about the use of athelas, about the elf/dwarf love triangle, about Radagast being portrayed as a buffoon - but my main point is that, while this film is sometimes entertaining, it is unlike The Hobbit, in plot or in spirit. The bare similarities and the fine technical aspects made me give it a grudging 7, but after further consideration I felt 5 was more realistic.

VThe general consensus is that "The desolation of Smaug" has generally succeeded in avoiding the pitfall of "An unexpected journey": an excruciatingly slow pacing. Even when I was not particularly bothered by the somewhat languid pace of "Journey", I did find "Smaug" more entertaining, at least in the conventional perception of entertainment. With the groundwork nicely laid in the first movie, the sequel moves along in welcomed simplicity, tracing the quest (this, I coined) to recover treasures in The Lonely Mountain. Sprinkled liberally with first-rate CGI action, the adventure unfolds in three parts: (1) the journey continues (highlighted by a spider colony), (2) Mirkwood Forest and (3) The Lonely Mountain (including its satellite Lake-town and the mountain itself). There is also a spin off line when Gandalf detours by himself, meets Radagast ("The Brown") and together visit Dol Guldur where they make the devastating discovery that Sauron is abroad again.\u000a\u000aJust as in the first movie, there are welcome links to LOTR, first through the two hauntingly beautiful Howard Shore creation of the themes for the Hobbits (soothing and heart-warming) and the Ring (mysterious and sinister). By far the most popular addition in this one is Orlando Bloom reprising Legolas – and they even have the name of Gimli thrown in for good measure (mentioned by his father). Of the new characters, Tauriel the lovely Elf (and Legolas's love interest) outshines all others. Portraying her is Evangeline Lilly whom you would not forget if you have seen her in "Real Steel" (2011) where she radiates heart-melting warmth whenever she is on the screen. Here, she and Bloom team up in some of the best Elven gymnastics scenes that you have ever witnessed. And then, during a healing scene speaking Elvin words of magic, you could almost believe that you are looking at Liv Tylor as Arwen.\u000a\u000aOf the other newcomers, Luke Evan is the most prominent as the boatman who smuggles our protagonists (all 14 of them) to Lake-town, a man name Bard who is actually more than what meets the eye. Another veteran Stephen Fry (brother Mycroft to Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes) plays the politically shred mayor of the town. For another Sherlock association, lead actor Martin Freeman's partner in the B.B.C. TV serious of updated Sherlock Holmes, Benedict Cumberbatch provides the voice for the titular creature Smaug.\u000a\u000aPeople who are dismayed at the cliffhanger hook at the end really have no cause to be. It is all but expected. The question is just that whether the conclusion "There and back again" in 2014 will satisfy. That, we can only wait to find out.

VFantasy lovers will have a hard time disliking Peter Jackson's newest Hobbit film. I have read the books and seen all the LOTR movies. Loved them all. I have to say this newest one is a disappointment. There are mega special effects, all very well done, but little characterization. It seems there is just one battle scene after another. I don't have a problem with Jackson straying from the actual Hobbit story line. But there is very little story here.\u000a\u000aThe dragon, Smaug, is very well done as is his voice. Better luck next year, Peter. I look forward to the last of your Hobbit trilogy. Middle Earth is a great place to hang out.

VAfter being carted away by "The Eagles are Coming!", our troop is still playing Hide and Seek with Azog's Orc-Pack.\u000a\u000aBut we have to have a Flashback First. Once again we see Peter Jackson walking around Bree with a Carrot in his mouth. In "The Fellowship of the Ring" we met his daughter as one of the cute little Hobbit kids. This time, she is a "Butterbur" (The Ostlers of "The Prancing Pony"), carting tankards of Ale to Thorin and Gandalf, one year earlier. Just look for the girl that looks like Peter Jackson. Here is talked about Thrain's Disappearance, Thorin's father- Who wielded the last of the Seven Dwarf Rings. As Gandalf tells Thorin, they would need a Burglar...\u000a\u000aFade to Bilbo spying on Azog's pack, and he sees a huge Bear. Gandalf tells him this Bear might be an Ally, he will either help them - Or kill them.\u000a\u000aSo they take refuge in a House, Gandalf not telling them it's The Bear's house, until The Bear is chasing them into it. The Bear is "Beorn" (Mikael Persbrandt), and it just so happens that he hates Orcs and Goblins more than Dwarfs - So they have a temporary Ally.\u000a\u000aThis film had a lot of the things I was waiting to see, Mirkwood, The Spiders, and the Wood-Elves Kingdom. Lee Pace is Thranduil, Legolas' Father. It just makes Sense that Legolas is there, and if he were true to character, he would have helped the band of Dwarfs just like he helped Aragorn and Gimli. Peter Jackson creates a She-Elf out of thin- air, "Tauriel" (Evangeline Lilly) who is very Elf. I don't have any trouble with this either, she neither adds nor takes away anything, and gives us something very pretty to look at. But she only has eyes for Fili, much to Legolas' Chagrin.\u000a\u000aSince The Hobbit was written as if Bilbo wrote it, these little facts and characters didn't need to be written in, so it's up to us to fill in the blanks, with Jackson's help. And Tauriel is very much an Elf, displaying many of the powers that Arwen had.\u000a\u000aWhile the Dwarfs plus Bilbo get "wrapped up" in Mirkwood, Gandalf has to go to the High Fells of Rhudaur. This is part of the back-story of the Witch King of Angmar, the leader of the Ring-Wraiths.\u000a\u000aThese two stories get told side-by-side for the rest of this film and beginning of the last, much the same way Lord of the Rings told up to five stories at once, we have the Orcs - Azog and Bolg, who is introduced here, summoning Azog to Dul Goldur. We have the Wood-Elves Kingdom, we have Laketown, and the bargeman Bard's (Luke Evans) relationship with the Master of Laketown, and his history, Evans also plays Bard's ancestor Girion, the archer who shot the Black Arrows at Smaug at Dale and missed, but in fact causing a chink in Smaug's armor, to be abused by Bard 60 years later. Laketown creates the opportunity for many characters and interactions to take shape.\u000a\u000aBut mainly, the Dwarfs get to Erebor on Durin's Day, even though their party has been split up, Kili and some others left at Laketown, where Bolg attacks, giving Orlando Bloom the opportunity to be Action Hero again. It seems that Legolas has the Skill to kill Bolg (Lawrence Makaore, who was the Witch King in Return of the King), just not the luck to do it this time.\u000a\u000aWe finally get to see the Whole Smaug this time, not just his nostril or eye. This is one of the best Dragons of Film, CGI or Not, almost as good as the Dragon from the early 80's film "Dragonslayer".\u000a\u000aSome of the interaction between Smaug and the Dwarfs is expanded a bit, but in the end, Smaug smells Laketown on Bilbo and flies off for retribution. But not before he gets to take a kind of Swim and gets a shiny new coat...\u000a\u000aIf "An Unexpected Journey" hinted at many of the things to come, "Desolation of Smaug" gets into the details much more, further connecting this trilogy to the "second" one. In a way, I wish this trilogy had been made first, or that less time had been between the two. That way the reaction to this one would have been less jaded.\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to film, what do people want? Three more Expendables films? More Schwarzenegger films? I think this era's moviegoers, well they may be fine - But it is all of these Internet Eberts who create 50 IMDb accounts, just to try to scrag the ratings of one film, that ruin the enjoyment of the people who went to see it. And if you check the join date of every bad review or 1-star rating, you'll see it was "One Day Ago" - And I'll bet they pirated a copy of it just to watch it - If they watched it at all, which I doubt.

VI just finished watching this movie, and it was such a disappointment that I signed up to IMDb just to be able to vote 1 for it. For anyone who didn't read the books, it's a big-budget but just decent fantasy movie. Nothing to get excited about, but it's an okay movie I guess. The acting is OK, the Tolkien parts of the script is awesome, and the added stuff is really cheesy. Animations are pretty good. Smaug could look more scary and less Jar-Jar. Some of the dwarfs should tone it down a bit. Some of them should look like dwarfs.\u000a\u000aBut for me, who read Tolkiens works as a child, and who loved them dearly, it was just frustrating to watch this. They didn't stop at adding stuff, they even changed events from the book. If you are the kind of person who were bothered that they didn't include Tom Bombadill in the Lord of the Rings, then don't watch this movie. It's worse than just 2 hours wasted. It's painful.

VWARNING: Some of the info here may be regarded as spoilers. Do not read if you have not seen the film.\u000a\u000aThe stars are purely for a few fine visuals.\u000a\u000aI cannot separate my Hobbit watching from my decades-long Tolkien obsession. Therefore, I cannot review this film except from the perspective of a disappointed Tolkien fan. But so what? That is, in fact, a perfectly valid perspective to take on a film based on a well- known and beloved book and created universe. When a film maker sets out to do a film with such source material, he accepts that certain expectations come with it. Sadly, Peter Jackson, who is a Tolkien fan himself, has jumped the shark in these Hobbit movies. For the record, I love the LotR films by Jackson. They are not perfect, but they are largely faithful in spirit to the source material. Where he deviates, I understand WHY he deviated, even if I don't always agree with the changes. Sometimes, he even improves on Tolkien. I have been surprised at certain details which I thought I remembered from the books, only to find they actually came from the films. But mostly, the LotR films are explainable in terms of Tolkien's world. In addition, the very way the films were made makes that world seem like a real, living place. The characters seem like real people or creatures. In contrast, the Hobbit movies are mostly artificial and contrived. I cannot detail all of the ways that The Desolation of Peter Jackson-- Smaug, I mean--grated on me. That would require more viewings than I am willing to give the film and more time and effort than it is worth. So let me give one example each of where Jackson added something which might have worked, but blew it, and where he simply blew it. 1.)Elf-Dwarf relationships. Sorry, but Elves and Dwarfs simply don't fall in love, ever. It's contrary to both of their natures by everything that we know about the races from Tolkien. Therefore, it is contrary to Nature itself. That means the very idea is just too damn kinky for Tolkien's world. HOW IT COULD HAVE WORKED: Tauriel strikes up a simple friendship with Kili. That's perfectly plausible as we know from Legolas's later friendship with Gimli (and Kili is quite likable, maybe TOO likable for a dwarf). Legolas could have been indignant that Tauriel was friends with a dwarf. That would have been a wonderfully ironic stance for Legolas in light of future events. It would have added depth to Legolas's character across the trilogies, as would have his relationship with Tauriel. But the "love triangle" angle is preposterous on its face. 2.) The decision to go full CGI with the baddies. I'm sure that the gray guy chasing the dwarfs around for most of the film will be a fine villain in the video game, but Lurtz from The Fellowship of the Ring was FAR more menacing because he had a real presence in the form of a real flesh and blood actor playing him on screen. Jackson just blew it in the basic decision process here. In a tendency which is visible even in the LotR trilogy, and which has grown in every film since then, he is letting his movie-making toys gradually overwhelm his simple movie- making good sense. This has not been a happy trend for him, in my estimation. RANDOM GRIPES: --Smaug was the most interesting character in the film, as in the book. No problem. But why am I more impressed with the dragon from Dragonslayer of 32 years ago than with the smooth CGI creation here? --I hated the whole Lake Town sequence. It was depressingly ridiculous. --Why don't these dwarfs have BEARDS?? Even young dwarfs have BEARDS-- long, flowing beards-- not just a few random whiskers. --Decide, Peter. Are the dwarfs hardy adventurers or bumbling clowns? They can't be both. It throws the tone off. --It is perfectly clear from Tolkien's writings that Gandalf enters Dol Guldur by stealth. He is flat out forbidden by the Valar to match power with power against the Enemy. We don't need Gandalf to try to be some bad ass hero dude. He needs to be smart, know his limitations, and work with the White Council. Sauron was sort of cool, but the sequence was not. I will dutifully go to see the third film, also, but I won't care to ever see any of these films again, in all probability. Final gripe: spell check keeps changing d*w*a*r*v*e*s to "dwarfs." Sigh...

VTotal disappointment by " The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug". The story is completely distorted, completely, without any reason. I couldn't believe my eyes Why, why, why??? I am sure Tolkien is turning in his grave like a whipping-top. I can understand they've needed a female warrior to attract more audience, OK. I understand they needed more battles with orcs - this may bring more money from the brainwashed public.\u000a\u000aBut a stupid love story between a dwarf and an elf??? Beorn looks like a monkey??? Smaug the dragon is so dumb??? And the dwarfs themselves - half of them top models, the other half - freaks of nature? Gandalf recognising Sauron?????? Whaaaaaat?????? \u000a\u000aAnd many more... \u000a\u000aThis is a crime towards this genius, amazing book, to its creator, the great Tolkien, and to us, the fans. SHAME!!!

VIt rates a completely unjustifiable 8.1 on the Incredibly Muddled Dodgy Blog, therefore I am only adding this unnecessary review to attempt a balance. The irrelevant extensive additions to the original story add nothing at all, including the ridiculous over-long computer game-esque fight and chase sequences. I admired Jackson for Brain Dead but what he did to the trilogy was smear audience capture clichés all over it after removing far more relevant elements of the story. He has done that here in spades in order to spin it out and keep costs down. Why bother with a plot when you can have another fight sequence or another chase. I'm really, really, really glad I did not pay to watch this and felt very let down by its greedy stupidity after it was lifted from a pretty good yarn by Tolkien. Never mind the complete alteration of a great plot to provide a three letter word guide for the dumdums who managed to sit through the trilogy listening to the ghastly fake Celtic music.

VLike a Michael Bay movie, The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug delivers one-liners, flat characters, and constant running battles. It's a far cry from the epic splendour of the Lord of the Rings movies or the original source material.\u000a\u000aCentral characters are reduced to thin caricatures of themselves. Thorin comes across as petty rather than regal, weakly acted by Richard Armitage. His mood swings seem more like the tantrums of a teenager than the tortured efforts of a man who's lost his home to reclaim what is rightfully his. The glory and tragedy are lost.\u000a\u000aThere are some truly illogical bits that killed the suspension of disbelief. Even a hero as powerful as Bard could not move a ten-ton barge by swishing the rudder back and forth. Legolas suffers from a classic unlimited-ammo scenario. I counted 72 dead orcs without reloading his bow — he's known by his fellow Mirkwood elves as "Rambo" perhaps.\u000a\u000aGandalf's side adventures show more potential. I don't mind, in principle, expanding the story with material from the Lord of the Rings. But Gandalf's encounter with Sauron, while visually astounding, doesn't ring true. I don't recall Gandalf being captured in Dol Guldur. That's a big blow to the reputation of Gandalf, in a series that is otherwise trying to remain true to Tolkien's core story.\u000a\u000aThe Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug isn't so much epic as action movie. It's a series of lengthy running battles punctuated by occasional one-liners. Plot and character are sacrificed for more arrows, more leaps, more dizzying 3D zooms through beautifully realized battlefields.\u000a\u000aThis is not The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien, this is The Hobbit by Michael Bay.

VThe visuals and technical imagery are brilliant, the action/chasing well-paced, the dragon quite stunning, but on every other aspect of storytelling -- plot, narrative, dialogue, character-development – this movie is so poor.\u000a\u000aI don't understand why a reasonably well-told and rather charming story (albeit, literature-wise, a bit slight) should be denuded of all its wit, charm and intelligence, and actual tension, and be converted to this corpse-strewn romp through Middle Earth, in such a dumb, stolid, uninspired and fundamentally sloppy fashion.\u000a\u000aThere are four aspects which had me shaking my head in despair.\u000a\u000aOne -- the bits that were in the book. These are glossed over, mostly to get to bits that weren't in the book. The encounter with Beorn is turned into a scene of somewhat arbitrary rationale (first he is chasing the dwarfs, who hide from him inside his own house; then he is protecting them because they are slightly higher up the hate-scale than their pursuers); the eerie, mysterious Mirkwood turns into a follow-the-yellow-brick-road stroll, except the dwarfs are too incompetent even for that (see Three), and the supposedly tense stand-off between Dildo and Smaug is resolved in moments -- cue Thorin's dramatic entrance armed only with the sword he came in (yeah mate, the dragon that has slaughtered armies in their thousands is bound to shiver with fright when you show up with your massive tool).\u000a\u000aThis means we get more action, fighting then chasing, or chasing then fighting, or just fighting, where "fight" in this context means wholsesale slaughter of sword-fodder orcs. The good guys are, naturally, barely scathed; except for a slight leg-wound contrived for a might-as-well-have-had-subtitles sub-plot development (see Two) and Legolam getting a slight nose bleed, mostly because he forgets his qualities as an archer and fights the Big Baddie with a knife, rather than just shooting him. (Must have been out of range, or shame stayed his hand. It's a shame I've run out arrows, thought Legolam, and a shame the director hasn't chosen to share that with the movie-goers. Or think it through.)\u000a\u000aTwo -- the bits that weren't in the book. Strong female characters weren't, admittedly, a mainstay of the original story; those 1930s Cambridge Dons weren't renowned for their awareness of body parts below the neck, and only dimly aware of "chaps in skirts". So, to get over the homo-erotic twelve dwarfs being all boys together, we throw in a hot chick she-elf and give her a hugely improbable instant crush on a dwarf -- the only non-caricatured, completely in proportion, darkly good looking one of course. At least it raised the admittedly dim prospect of some seriously dirty dwarf-on-elf action (if only for a potentially redeeming scene with Kili pitilessly humping Tauriel from behind and shouting "Like the pointy ears, elf -- gives me something to ... hang on to!").\u000a\u000aThree -- the dwarfs are useless. Utterly, utterly useless. A more useless combination of 12 characters could only be generated by taking Ian Duncan Smith, Jeremy Cutter-Hunt and Michael Gove, and then cloning Gove 9 nine times. So far they have managed to get themselves trapped by 3 cave trolls, a bunch of goblins, some spiders, the wood elves and finally the loser humans so smart they live next to a dragon and immediately believe in the trickle-down economics rousingly proposed by Thorin. (Then again so many people have been swallowing that neo-liberal guff for the last 30 years this is wretchedly plausible...)\u000a\u000aHowever useless the dwarfs are (bearing in mind they've shared the minor details of their quest with everyone in Laketown, and still set off in search of a secret tunnel in order to take that dragon by surprise), those trying to catch them are even worse. So Azog the (supposedly) scary Orc repeatedly fails to catch the dwarfs where everyone or everything else succeeds. It is little wonder his armies get turned into chutney in LotR since he demonstrates an ineptitude on a scale so vast it that makes Douglas Haig look like a strategic mastermind. In fact he is only out-classed in stupidity by two characters, the first being Smaug himself, who is so stunningly useless he is outwitted by the dwarfs (for whom we have already established a stratospheric standard for incompetence) using a tactic that would embarrass a kindergarten. The second character being...\u000a\u000aFour -- Goodgulf, or Gandulf to use his stage name, is overwhelmingly useless. Not "Gandulf the Grey", more "Gandulf, the Fairly Shaite Wizard". If he is not abandoning the dwarfs to their collective fates, he is playing chicken. In the first movie, confronted by Azog, instead of invoking some mighty incantation, he runs up a tree and sets fire to fir cones (D&D's Magic Missile is actually Fiery Fir-cone, who knew?) with the added distinction that evidently self-preservation is not his strongest instinct as he sets alight the very object providing his protection. "I'm Gandulf, Gandulf the Grey. As in: Gandulf, the Rather Short on Grey Cells." Fortunately the bird-brained is saved by some birds for him to survive into this movie, where his contribution to the quest is to hide from the orcs, flee from the bearman, abandon the dwarfs at Mirkwood, and get himself captured in Dol Guldur; only the movie ends before any ornithological deus ex machina can save him. So next movie then...\u000a\u000aIncompetence on a Middle Earth scale. Unfortunately this extends to the story telling. I'm all for suspending belief and it being a fantasy and all that, but at least make the internal characterisation, motivation, plot etc consistent. It is so sloppy: my suspension of belief stops at the point where it is impossible to find some halfway decent scriptwriters who can tell a story properly and get all the action, romance, excuse for 3D visuals, etc the director wants into it, yet retain some flavour of the original story and a bit of internal logic.

VPeter Jackson is for sure a great director but didn't red the Lord of the Rings and didn't red The Hobbit; neither did Boyens and Walsh. Maybe they thought The Hobbit was too boring the way it was. They depicted The Hobbit as a prequel of Lord of the Rings with the same atmosphere, fights and frightens though The Hobbit is a book for children. As they did before in The Lord of the Rings they cut too much to introduce concepts, stories and people never occurred in the books. The films should report "loosely based on the books by J.R.R. Tolkien". Everything that's funny has been removed except the clumsiness of Bilbo and a few words from Gandalf. The whole spirit of the original book has been taken away.

VRight off the bat, I am no LOTR aficionado (LOTR would be 'Lord of The Rings' for all of us uninformed novices). I mean I did read the Tolkien books but felt they were only OK. Honestly, this whole yarn is no more than a dated, quasi-exciting fairytale. That being said, I really enjoyed the first Hobbit movie. It was an enjoyable, fun romp introducing Bilbo to his gang of voyagers and to the viewer. Fast paced and good tempo carried the day. Let's face it, this was the beginning. From that point on I knew this was going to be the exciting chronicles of Bilbo and his horde and their encounters with all kinds of weird and wonderful creatures. The first movie was solid (at least I thought it was) and it was primarily about Baggins. I was so stoked for the second (and last) movie to come out. I did not see where a third movie would be warranted or possible. Boy was I ever wrong? One more movie is all that was needed to wrap things up. Really, just one. Sean Connery said it best in 'Hunt for Red October', "one ping and one ping only." Alas, after suffering through this time-drag on my life, I decided I will not bother with the third (or fourth, or fifth, or sixth) Hobbit movie(s). There is really nothing left to see. Read the book again – maybe - OK? But this movie, wow, what a horribly disjointed bucket of twaddle. The story line vanished and was replaced by a knotted spindle of fishing line. And it seemed Bilbo (remember – the main character - you know - the guy this whole story was supposed to be about) was relegated to the position of afterthought, while a bunch of scene-steeling elves flew around and ruined the show. The writers might as well have written the little fella out of the story altogether. I mean, could this silly fiasco had been any longer or more more drawn out than what I endured? Could it - really? Oops, yes, another stupid question by me. Of course it could. The answer to this sad dilemma is a resounding yes. Hollywood never passes up an opportunity to fleece moviegoers of hard-earned cash at the drop of a hat. Maybe I am a bit rough (or maybe not?) Chasing that stupid dragon all around was another exhausting 'bit.' And after all of that running and slashing – that stupid fire breathing clown escapes. Well - I am done. I am done with LOTR, I am done with Hobbits and I am done with endless sequels. If a movie needs a sequel, it is a show and should be put it on TV.

VThis movie is about what I expected it to be. Aside from the plot and scene padding with questionably added characters, the use of High Frame Rate/3D technology gave the movie an eerie realism and starkness that took a while to digest. It had the look and feel of a reality TV show, which was fine, except when the CGI figures appeared. They weren't as real and it muddled the whole experience and ruined the fantasy illusion for me. This is the first movie I've seen that is truly immersive and I'm not sure I like being right in the middle of the action. That said, I tried to view it on its terms instead of holding on to my expectations.\u000a\u000aI read the book many years ago and don't have a problem with the whole "Jumping off point" approach, but what is lost here is something every good director and author knows. Good storytelling is lean, efficient, and concise, not ponderous, overly detailed, and (dare I say it?) bloated. There simply isn't enough engagement or grandeur here to justify a telling lasting nine hours. LOTR was different. Three books/three movies was appropriate because they were dense stories. This story isn't and I found myself asking, "what did that scene have to do with anything? It wasn't in the book and it wasn't really necessary." On the whole, "the Desolation of Smaug" suffers from the cinematic equivalent of TMI. With so many added players, individual character development was sorely lacking. "What was his/her name again?" is not a question one should ask. \u000a\u000aSince I don't believe in plot-spoilers, I can only say that the film also exhibits the risky pitfall of having multiple villains who don't seem to be aware of each other. I'm reminded of the Chinese aphorism about the fallacy of chasing two rabbits.\u000a\u000aIf you've invested your movie-going interest in the first Hobbit movie and you're a Tolkein fan, I'd say go ahead and see this film. It isn't going to offend you but it may tax your backside. You're supposed to like sitting there for three hours, right? If you're into cutting-edge filmmaking and love gratuitous CGI and jaw-dropping visuals at the expense of expert pacing, knock yourself out. \u000a\u000aTo plagiarize a 19th century Richard Wagner opera reviewer, "At 7pm I began to watch 'The Desolation of Smaug.' At 10pm, I looked at my watch. It said 7:15.

VPeter Jackson should remember that he is not J.R.R. Tolkien and should not rewrite The Hobbit as he thinks it should be written. \u000a\u000aHe won fans over by (more or less) keeping to the story in Lord of the Rings so why with the Hobbit has he decided to make so many changes that its almost another story. Why bring in the surfing Legolas with a love interest?, Why have such a long and drawn out conversation with something that looks more like a giant bat than a dragon?, Why the digression with Gandalf and Radagast and Sauron. The list goes on.... \u000a\u000aThe only conclusion I can make as obvious as it is, is that Hollywood success from LOTR has gone to Jacksons head and he is now in the business of misleading and deceiving fans of Tolkein.\u000a\u000aThe Hobbit is a small book it could have easily been done in one or at most two films, dragging it out to a third movie and adding a whole lot of unnecessary rubbish to a perfectly good story shows how little the producers respect the author and the story. \u000a\u000aThe special effects etc... as as good as ever. That is why I give it a 4 out of 10.

VI loved this film! It out did 'An Unexpected Journey' by a long shot. That film is good too. However 'Desolation of Smaug' delivers far more action, thrills, and its darker making it the better movie. Its a fantastic joy ride through Middle-earth. The special fx and art design are beyond superb. True eye candy! Loved the beautifully composed, and many times dark, music (score). All the cast members did a great job at performing their roles. The story is somewhat faithful to the book, however out of all director Peter Jackson's films based on Tolkien's world, this one deviates the most. It didn't bother me though. I understand its a movie, not a book. Certain liberties had to be taken (changes and additions) in order for this film to work. And it works remarkably well! I am a huge fan of Tolkien and was more than happy to experience more of Middle-earth in Jackson's pleasant view. It was lovely to see events from 'The Lord of the Rings' appendices. The director, cast, and crew do an outstanding job at succeeding expectations for die hard fans of the Tolkien universe. Just expect more than what is read in the only 300 page book many of us know. The barrel chase scene was exciting beyond my expectations. Smaug was absolutely impressive and terrifying. Also the events involving the Necromancer adds more depth and thrill to this film. Overall, best movie I've seen all year! And after the cliffhanger ending, I wait with great anticipation for 'The Hobbit: There and Back Again' due out late next year.

VLet's get the best news out of the way: As a movie Desolation of Smaug is much better movie than the Unexpected Jourrney was. It moves well, pacing is great, acting is mostly great, special effects, especially Smaug, look mostly stunning and the music and the set are great as ever.\u000a\u000aAnd here's the but: it takes a lot of liberties with the story. A lot of the scenes in the movie have only bare bones resemblance with the book. This, however, isn't a surprise, as the first movie altered the narrative from the book quite a bit. So you either roll with it and are okay with the changes, or you cringe your teeth. I rolled with em', as the movie itself is good.\u000a\u000aJust like the first movie, I saw this one in HFR as well. I must say, that during the first film of the series I had some issues with the quality, but now it looks like most of the small issues have been cleaned aside.\u000a\u000aLike the Two Towers, Desolation of Smaug has no real ending. Afer all is said and done, the movie comes into sudden stop, where, I assume, the third, and the last, movie will continue straight on.\u000a\u000aDoS is very entertaining, well crafted movie. It is a step up from the first movie and allows to expect good things from the last movie.

VThere are many "second instalment" films that outshine their predecessor. From The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather – Part II to The Dark Knight, some films are just an appetiser for the main meal.\u000a\u000aPeter Jackson's The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug follows on from his disappointing 2012 feature film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey with ten times the action and excitement to make this second title in the Hobbit series a feast for moviegoers.\u000a\u000aKicking off with a flashback to a year before Bilbo Baggins came into the orbit of the vanquished Dwarfs of Erebor, Gandalf the Grey urges Thorin Oakenshield to seek out the Arkenstone to reclaim the throne of the Kingdom Under the Mountain, before slipping neatly into the time frame shortly after the first film ended.\u000a\u000aIf the first film was lacking in happenings and characters, this one more than makes up for it. Skin Changer Beorn keeps the attacking Orcs at bay before taking human shape and explaining he'll help the dwarfs despite detesting their kind, because the only thing he hates more than little folk are Orcs.\u000a\u000aAnd it's no wonder. These foul creatures will star in many a nightmare for younger viewers.\u000a\u000aHere's a film to avoid if you dislike gigantic spiders. Also dizzying heights, fire breathing dragons, decapitation, sword-fights, Elves, Wizards, poison, puzzles and spooky forests.\u000a\u000aThe way that Peter Jackson is able to weave his magic with real live action seamlessly integrated with CGI is phenomenal.\u000a\u000aA film to cherish in 3D, and pore over again on DVD & Blu-Ray.\u000a\u000ajabbatron.com

VI really enjoyed the first Hobbit film, and I was not disappointed by the second. This Hobbit film is darker than the first one, with the darker story, visit fights and even the desolate grayscale color scheme. The story drags on a little in the beginning, and I wondered where the magnificent scenes are. When the gang finally arrive at the mountain, I was completely blown away by the amazing visuals of the Dragon and its flames. The ending finale is a series of wows, as the flames, and the color change of the Dragon is very impressive. The ending elicited another wow from me, as it is so abrupt. I really thought and wish there was more after the ending. Do I really have to wait a year or two to find out what happens after?

VThis movie takes a big step up from the first movie. The movie is intense from the start to the end, in a very good way! The story is following the book very well. The dragon may have more lives than in the book, but the scenes are fantastic anyway. . The film gets a big lift by more characters to follow. Peter jackson does the sequel superb by telling the story with a lot of exiting action throughout the movie. Martin freeman plays the role as Bilbo Baggins extremely well yet again. I can't wait to for the final chapter in the hobbit masterpiece by Peter Jackson who blows you in to middle earth yet again! The hobbit and the lord of the rings will be the greatest master piece of all time! In a 100 years these films will be the Mona Lisa of films! I would recommend you go see this movie over and over again!

VThis 2nd Hobbit film is an exciting continuation of the first Hobbit film - lots of action to go with the fantasy and adventure in this installment. I loved it! After Gandalf leaves them behind for another quest, Bilbo, Thorin and the rest of the Dwarfs end up coming face to face with the wood-elves king Thranduil, his son Legolas and Tauriel - after escaping the clutches of king Thranduil, Bilbo and the dwarfs meet a bargeman called Bard who smuggles them into Laketown - some scuffing goes and and they finally reach their destination: The Lonely Mountain. Meanwhile, Gandalf goes to Dol Guldur - Sauron's keep in Mirkwood to find out if the enemy (Sauron) has indeed come back to take over Middle Earth. Gandalf is held captive there and watches helplessly as the orcs descend on Lake Town at the foot of the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo tries to gain the Arkenstone from the dragon Smaug but awakens him... the dwarfs and Bilbo now have their hands full and the film ends with Smaug the dragon heading to Laketown for revenge.\u000a\u000a10/10

VI thought the first Hobbit film, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, was just about passable, although spoilt by the inclusion of random CGI action scenes and a general lowbrow comedy feel. Unbelievably, this sequel, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG, is even worse. Peter Jackson's once undeniable talents as a director seem to be rapidly departing him, as he's churned out a random CGI kid's adventure film which has virtually no resemblance to the middle section of the Tolkien novel.\u000a\u000aThe problem with this overlong and incredibly dull movie is the amount of extraneous material. Whoever thought it was good idea to bring back Legolas (complete with CGI eyes this time around) was an idiot. His ridiculous fight scenes are an embarrassment. I could just about cope with Arwen's presence in THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, but Evangeline Lilly's presence here is unforgivable.\u000a\u000aThe CGI is constant and unending. Most of the backdrops are done with CGI, and even the orcs are now CGI too. They look poor, very poor. We even get CGI moths and butterflies and CGI bumblebees. Jackson has no idea that less is more when it comes to computer effects and instead keeps plonking them in constantly, resulting in a film which looks fake from beginning to end. Performances across the board are poor - the actors are merely required to interact with CGI scenery after all, and a sense of weariness and exasperation has set in - and the long-winded bit where Bilbo finally makes it to Smaug's lair is sleep-inducing, it's so dragged out. However, the stupid barrels-down-the-rapids sequence has to be the nadir of the whole thing...

VAfter the disappointment of "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey", I hadh fairly low standards for the second film. It started off incredibly well, but then spiralled into a mess of deus-ex-machinas, disrespectful book deviations, and unnecessary heterosexual romance.\u000a\u000aThe pros:\u000a\u000aThe cinematography and visual design. From the caverns of Erebor to the Halls of the Woodland King, the film's artistic direction is so amazingly detailed. Again, the filmmakers use the beautiful scenery of New Zealand to create the world of Middle-Earth. It's honestly breathtaking.\u000a\u000aBilbo (Martin Freeman) and Thorin's (Richard Armitage) character development stories are coming along great. Bilbo is becoming braver and more proactive; Thorin is starting to respect him. Both actors, in my opinion, are perfect for their roles - Freeman is natural in his lightness and often comedic relief, while Armitage carries a gravity well-suited to Thorin's pride and severity. Ian Mckellen has always been brilliant as Gandalf, and always will be.\u000a\u000aI cannot stress enough how amazing the Mirkwood scenes are. The visuals of the forest, the dim lighting, the slow cameras and the illusionary special effects create the forest's heavy and stifling atmosphere perfectly. The feeling of wrongness was so strong and so well- crafted. \u000a\u000aBut then it all went downhill.\u000a\u000aThe cons:\u000a\u000aI can pinpoint the exact second when everything started going wrong: when Legolas and the other Elves slide down the branches to kill the giant spiders. \u000a\u000aThe very inclusion of the Elves, in my opinion, was a mistake. It heavily detracts from Bilbo and the dwarfs' story. The whole Elf- Dwarf superiority complex is incredibly irritating - the film always portrays Elves as the pinnacle of civilisation while the Dwarfs are crude, greedy and unskilled in combat. It's not a good idea to antagonise thirteen of your main characters. And Legolas' appearance seems to be just for the sake of pulling in viewers.\u000a\u000aTauriel and Kíli. Oh boy, where do I begin? Firstly, it undermines Legolas and Gimli's friendship in "The Lord of the Rings". Secondly, they lack chemistry and their romance is so forced and cringeworthy. Thirdly, how Tauriel goes from, "Do not think I will give you a weapon, Dwarf" to going all moon-eyed over Kíli in the time frame of a few hours. I could go on.\u000a\u000aTauriel herself is written fairly badly. I liked the idea of a badass elf lady, but everything she does is for Kili's sake. Jackson and co. have obviously neglected to research (or more likely, deliberately ignored) Elven history with her red hair and attraction to Kili. Tolkien worked so hard to create a wonderful fantasy world, and it's been destroyed in the matter of a few minutes by Jackson and co.\u000a\u000aThe Company splits up. That's right. Fíli, Kíli, Bofur and Oin remain in Lake-Town, while the rest of the Dwarfs march on Erebor. Why? It doesn't add anything to the plot, except to develop Kíli and Tauriel's grating, unrealistic romance by romanticising Kíli's injury.\u000a\u000aThere were so many unnecessary plot lines. The scenes with the orcs' point of view don't add anything. There's too much focus on The Master and Alfrid. There shouldn't be this much emphasis on secondary characters when not all thirteen Dwarfs have their own personalities yet.\u000a\u000aThe alright:\u000a\u000aThe Dwarfs taking on Smaug. It makes their vendetta a little more personal, I guess. They did fairly interesting things to try to kill him, and we get a good look at the insides of Erebor. Gandalf and the Dol Guldur subplot were alright. It was nice to see him doing more magic, as we didn't get that much in "The Lord of the Rings".\u000a\u000aOverall, the film was quite poor. It started off wonderfully and then just began deviating too much from the book to be a good adaptation. Even though the tone was much more consistent than the first movie, "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" treats Tolkien's world and works in an unapologetically dismissive and disrespectful manner.\u000a\u000aI'm sorry to say that "The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies" is much worse. If you found this film unengaging, you will certainly find the last instalment unbearable.

VBilbo Baggins, Gandalf the wizard and the band of dwarfs continue their quest to find a secret door to the Lonely Mountain and reclaim their gold. But Smaug the Dragon has no intention of giving up his glittering cache …\u000a\u000aThe second movie in the Hobbit trilogy has the classic The Empire Strikes Back flaw - it doesn't have a beginning or an ending - but despite this, it is fantastic entertainment and arguably even better than its predecessor. It shares some of the first movie's problems, primarily that it's too long, but it is less excessive and feels much closer to the novel, both in narrative and atmosphere. Where it adds new characters, such as the elf warrior Tauriel and the returning Legolas (Bloom reprising his star turn from the Lord Of The Rings movies), for the most part they feel natural and add a richness to Bilbo's quest, although there is an unnecessary subplot to link this story back to the earlier film trilogy. As ever though, the realisation of these environments is simply irresistible, with gorgeous sets, paintings, props, design and music always a feast for the eyes and ears. The creepy, soul-sucking, spider-infested Mirkwood and the tired, ramshackle, built-on-stilts Laketown are highlights in a film filled with visual delights. The whole escape-in-the-barrels sequence - one of the best bits from the book - is brilliantly realised, with an eye-popping ten-minute action sequence as our heroes hurl down the rapids, confronted by perils on all sides; one of the best chase scenes I've seen for years. If I have one minor complaint though, it's in the characterisation of Smaug himself; visually he is wonderful, terrifying and humorous in equal measure, but his scenes drag on too long. In the book he is horror personified - the monster who can smell an invisible burglar a mile away - but in the movie he talks far too much and skitters dangerously close to becoming a buffoon, as for all his powers he constantly misses, fumbles and goes the wrong way. Like The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, my personal view is that this film could be much more fun, action-packed and scarier with a little judicious pruning. This doesn't however detract from what is simply a fabulous adventure movie from beginning to end. Brilliantly photographed throughout by Andrew Lesnie, who sadly passed away recently, and along with fellow Australian Dean Semler created many of the most memorable images of Antipodean cinema. Followed in 2014 by the concluding part of the trilogy, The Battle Of The Five Armies.

V... made The Hobbit in 1977 and Return of the King in 1980. Great songs, excellent dialogue and voice characterization, and memorable.\u000a\u000aLOTR from Peter Jackson was awesome, everything I'd hoped for. Elijah Wood kicked butt and everyone was on task. Great effects and scenery, super battle scenes (even if the siege looks directly from Army of Darkness). Characters have plenty to do, and we CARE!\u000a\u000aThe first Hobbit from Jackson was a travesty. Rude dwarfs invited by a disjointed Gandalf plunder a pleasant Baggins abode, and this take an HOUR. By the end of the first film, I actually wanted half the dwarfs to die. Arrogant, not worthy of anything. The "roller-coaster" rides were unending, and the fall through the Goblin kingdom was worse than a video game. Bilbo was cool, as was Gollum, and so I gave it B+.\u000a\u000aThis Hobbit is better, but not by much. Smaug, as many have pointed out, is an idiot. He may have a fine speaking voice and a vocabulary, but he has ADHD issues, and it's not funny, and not TRYING to be funny! Sad. The dwarfs are even MORE ungrateful, and Thorin's turn for the Arkenstone is tired after knowing the Ring is of the same persuasion.\u000a\u000aI also found there to be many problems with logic. For example, if the eagles are willing, why bother with a land quest? Just take Eagle Airlines to Lonely Mountain.\u000a\u000aAs well, I'm really tired of Orcs who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn, and have no talent with weapons. Remind me again why we should be afraid of these pathetic creatures? Oh yeah, there's lots of 'em. Like cockroaches.\u000a\u000aBilbo's innocent act also wears thin. He doesn't grow weary OR that much more courageous, as both Frodo and Samwise do in LOTR. Bilbo acts like it's just a ride at Disneyland.\u000a\u000aI'll stop now. I feel bad dumping on it like this.

VOnce again met with a good not great film. I enjoyed it, it looked nice, it had good action and nice enough characters. But it doesn't come close to the epic adventure of LOTR, which might just be a testament to the books rather than the films. I liken these to the Pirates of the Caribbean series; a family friendly adventure with lots of scenes of just playing around with the characters in light hearted action (I immediately thought of the giant wheel rolling scene in the second pirates film when all the dwarfs were going down the river in the barrels). I enjoyed having more lines and involvement from the individual dwarfs, though I do still think there should be more. Each dwarf has his own personality which I don't think gets enough attention for me. I understand there is only so much they can do as there is a hell of a lot of characters, but maybe take out the Legolas pining over Kate from Lost element and add in some dwarf time. I also felt Bilbo took a backseat through the first 2 3rds of the film, which is obviously because it's a continuing story through 1 book, but it doesn't come across well in film I found.

VIn my opinion, The Two Towers was the best film of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It hit a very sweet spot and said some very interesting things about storytelling in the nature of setup and payoff. The Hobbit's The Desolation of Smaug isn't in the same league as The Lord of the Rings, needless to say, and it doesn't even live up to the mild entertainment of An Unexpected Journey. It has no payoffs to offer. This is an utter chore to get through. I don't care enough to go into detail, I'm not invested in any facet of this instalment of Middle Earth. I get that Jackson kind of wants this whimsical shimmering aesthetic but holy moly it couldn't be messier. It's cool to watch the elves wreck things up, but it's littered with so much video game physics that the immersion is gone, if it was ever there in the first place. While some moments are alright, Martin Freeman makes the best of it when he has any focus, it just feels like a soulless money grab.\u000a\u000a5/10

VPeter Jackson continues to stretch out Tolkein's timeless classic, no doubt building himself a pile of treasure almost as impressive as that of Smaug in the process. In this second part of three, the thirteen dwarfs, accompanied by one brave hobbit, continue their quest to reclaim their homeland of Erebor and retrieve the precious hoard guarded there by an ancient evil dragon. On their way, they are attacked by giant spiders in the forest of Mirkwood, escape from the woodland elves in barrels, travel to Laketown and find their way into the heart of the Lonely Mountain to confront the mighty fire breathing reptile. Plus lots of other stuff that wasn't written by Tolkein.\u000a\u000aWith the rather slight book (at least when compared to LOTR) being turned into a trilogy, there is a lot here that has been completely made-up by Jackson and company, a fact that will no doubt upset many Tolkein purists. Those viewers who are not that bothered about the additional new material might be rankled by the overuse of CGI, the overblown set pieces that see our death-defying heroes surviving numerous dangers against the odds, and an unnecessary romance. Anyone not bothered by these trifling matters will probably have a whale of a time, happily sitting through all 161 minutes with a big dumb smile on their face; I wish I could be so easily pleased.\u000a\u000aTo be fair, I did have a marginally better time with this part than I did with An Unexpected Journey: there's not so much puerile humour or singing this time around, there are no silly battling stone-giants, and my favourite bit of the book—the barrel escape—is in this chapter (although Jackson does his best to muck it up by having the dwarfs pursued by orcs along the way). Overall, however, I still consider this another disappointment from the once great director, a ridiculously padded adventure that could have and should have been absolutely awesome, but which ends on a particularly duff note by pointlessly drawing out the confrontation between Bilbo and Smaug by chucking those bloody dwarfs into the mix for an over-the-top CGI-fest of a finalé.

VTHE DESOLATION OF SMAUG boasts some of the most beautiful locations I've ever laid eyes on- and some truly unbelievable sets. Unfortunately, that's about all. This is clearly filler between parts Last and Next, and it's also the biggest information dump I think I've ever seen in my life. Characters are introduced one after another so fast that it's nigh impossible to keep track of who's who- and the inter-cutting between The Quest and The Rest does absolutely nothing to make matters clearer. In fact, this constant cutting back and forth effectively undermines any attempt(s) at building suspense; there is NONE whatsoever. And Bilbo's big confrontation with Smaug is milked for far, far more than its worth: by the time the movie abruptly ends, it's almost impossible to give a s--- one way or the other. At two and a half hours, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG offers more Gab than anything else.

VNot quite sure where the whole extra love match/story is coming from between elf and dwarf (not from the book, that's for sure). And I was trying to figure out after watching the "Hobbit" (An Unexpected Journey) why the Orc's were not only speaking a completely different language than the first trilogy (Fellowship Of The Ring, Two Towers and Return Of The King) but they were also made to look completely different than in the first three films. Not all that much time passes from the story of "The Hobbit" and "The Lord Of The Rings"... Why steer so far away from what was an amazing job on making the "Lord Of The Rings" books come to life on the big screen?

VThe Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug (2013) directed by Peter Jackson\u000a\u000aApologies for the lateness of this review, it dropped of my list in the post-Christmas confusion, re-watching it in 3D on Blu-Ray over Easter reminded me I needed to get round to it. Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said, it's big, it's loud and it's full of elves, dwarfs and Stephen Fry. \u000a\u000aFor Middle Earth nerds it's highly likely there might be bits of this movie that actually hurt, like the bit where Legolas is retrofitted to the storyline as one of the morally questionable wood elves or the love interest that develops between a dwarf and a ninja wood elf. Such purists would point out the significance of the relationship between Gimli (passing reference is made to the small bearded one in this film) and Legolas in LOTR is that it is the first positive engagement between elf and dwarf in hundreds of years that's why it's so important. But this isn't a film for Middle Earth nerds, they'll generally still be lost in the convolutions of the Silmarillion, this is an epic for the masses who like dwarfs and swords and dragons and seeing orcs skewered three to an arrow in a rocking-rolling barrel chase (this bit is undoubtedly the best bit of the film).\u000a\u000aMartin Freeman is pitch perfect as Bilbo, with that I've-just-lost-something face and halting way of speaking that endears all but the most hard-hearted of Hobbit haters. Ian McKellen's Gandalf now looks so wizened his eyes are almost closed for the entire film, his grey coat and crooked pointy hat the high fashion mark of dilapidated wizardy. Gandalf doesn't feature greatly in this movie, trundling off to face the mysterious Necromancer, who turns out to be the reincarnating Sauron, arriving ninety years too soon for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the rumble-throated Smaug with suitable Shakespearian grandiosity and the dwarfs are variously cute, hairy and mischievous, although James Nesbitt's role in this one seems much reduced which is a shame.\u000a\u000aHaving taken the 300 hundred odd pages of The Hobbit and spread them over what will be 9 hours of film I do wonder what is going to happen in movie 3 as this instalment finishes about 3 pages from the end of the book. The one could have done with being a good 40 minutes shorter because by the time we meet the magnificent dragon we're really beginning to flag.\u000a\u000aEnjoyable enough, but it did feel a little marmitey, you know the kind of thing, too little flavour spread over a large area. Watchable but take a pillow, flask and sandwiches.\u000a\u000a*** Three stars

VTurning the book into a trilogy was a big mistake after all.\u000a\u000aDespite the stunning visuals and awe-inspiring wide angle shots, the movie is so needlessly dragged it surely has to bore a tolkein fan.\u000a\u000aThe movie is rife with needless plots, dramatized dialogues, poor acting, painfully boring romance. In short, PJ has desperately tried to put in as much stuff as he could in a 3 hr period.\u000a\u000aBut when the film falls terribly short in most of the major areas, the visual effects team comes out best than ever before. Alan Lee and John Howe (the illustrators) have done an incredible job in creating the smaug, which is nothing short of a spectacle and perhaps the only saving grace of the film.\u000a\u000aTo put it short, the movie packs in the best visual effects as compared to the previous lotr/hobbit movies and should be your only reason to watch the movie, everything else is a disaster.

VThe internal debate. When disappointed by the initial instalment of a trilogy, do you bite the bullet and give the second part a chance or steer clear to avoid further upset? I believe that in most cases, if you truly strive to enjoy a series then the former seems the obvious choice. Going in with poor expectations occasionally causes the viewer to dissect the following film. On another occasion, the bar is set so low that you are unable to be anything other than pleasantly surprised.\u000a\u000aWhen The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was released, I left my local multiplex completely underwhelmed. With almost a decade between The Return of the King and the initial prequel, I contemplated whether my tastes had simply changed in the passing time. Prior to Middle Earths resurgence on the big screen, HBO made a sizeable impact on the small screen with Game Of Thrones which offered a darker, more adult alternative to the fantasy epic genre. Where Jackson's envisioning of Tolkien's Middle Earth were condensed into three hour films, the television adaption of George R.R Martin's book saga was debuted weekly, allowing a higher threshold of character development without glancing over certain plot points.\u000a\u000aRegardless of these factors, surely the familiarity of such beautiful compositions as 'Concerning Hobbits' should have rekindled my past love for the franchise in those opening moments? It did, however the remainder of the film felt much different. Whilst the soundtrack felt familiar, including the new addition of the song of the 'Misty Mountains', the overall tone never seemed to reach a consistent note. Personally, it felt more akin to The Chronicles of Narnia adaptions than the previous Lord of the Rings trilogy with it's needless use of child orientated humour. Additionally, the creatures seemed to be heavily influenced by the input of Guillermo Del Toro with the Orcs taking a slightly contrasting appearance. Their presence moved further away from the more menacing, prosthetics based entities I had come to both respect and fear in my youth to a more CGI centric being.\u000a\u000aThe Desolation of Smaug is a much leaner, more refined continuation of the Hobbit storyline. Having already established all of the characters, the momentum is able to build at a faster pace without repeated introductions, moving swiftly between each set piece,from a conflict with a cluster of giant spiders to the groundbreaking encounter with the dragon, Smaug which showcases some of the finest CGI I have seen. On the contrary I felt that, excluding these two action sequences, the remainder of the effects were rather flawed as though they had spent all of their efforts on those key scenes. The rest of the film is weighed down by a comparatively horrendous usage of green-screens which will accelerate the ageing of the instalment in years to come.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, a balance between action and the progression of the cast seems out of reach. Perhaps prolonging the length of one book into a trilogy is the root of this problem with a limited amount of plot to cover. Some conflicts seem to border on filler and I felt there was a lack of conversation on some part amidst the hordes of Orcs although it did distinguish more defined combat styles. The Mongol-esque dismemberment of a spider by the Dwarfs and the graceful, honed battle skills of the Elves as they seemingly dance between their foes. The camaraderie feels less apparent than in the first trilogy and the lack of any fatalities to the company removes you from the same sense of danger that previous instalments emitted with Legolas or Tauriel rescuing our protagonists from any impending tragedies.\u000a\u000aOverall it was an enjoyable film, I just deem it lacks some of what I once felt was a more substantial part of the franchise and the essence of The Lord of the Rings; such as the emphasis on friendship and the adventurers persevering through hardships. On the other hand it did capture the undertone of how overpowering desires and obsessions can really contribute to someone's downfall. Despite some of the negativity within this review this sequel was a vast improvement full of excitement and ambition ensuring that it leaves viewers craving the conclusion to the Unexpected Journey.

VWell, the title says it all. You will watch it, because it's meant to be watched. Not read. Not given a thought. Watched, period. CGI candy. While I believe there are plenty of reviews of visual fans, stating how gorgeous the pixels moved, I'd rather present a cynical\u005ccritical approach to the various CGI scenes.\u000a\u000a*Warning - SPOILERS* >Spiders. Yet another extremely dangerous fight that leaves all dwarfs alive. Dwarfs lived through goblins, giants, orcs, spiders... Only to have hardscripted arrow hit one dwarf with a boner.\u000a\u000a>Treasure of Erebor. At least in Harry Potter there was Gemini Curse and magic. Do you expect me to believe that dwarfs just let these kilotons of gold lay around? That's below even hoarding, that's clinical, absurd and not even impressive.\u000a\u000a>Witch King's tomb. Probably one of the stupidest sequences in the whole movie. Gandalf goes in. "Summons Radaghast". Talks some scare. Alright, cut! Seriously, this tomb was mentioned in the previous movie - why the hell not show it? With all the stupid CGI scenes and Bilbo\u005cDragon flirting, why not show Gandalf actually explore the tomb, not look at the broken wall and realize: "Welp, we're screwed".\u000a\u000a>Bard. Faramir, yet another copycat from the original. Archer, douche, handsome.\u000a\u000a>Legolas and Tauriel. Damn, all they need is a pair of lightsabers and some Force to kick it. And introducing this elf just to mate her with dwarf for very obscure reason - right... Screen time! >Dol Guldur. It's a trap meme. Ah, screw it, once again there has to be screen time filler with no sense or purpose. And that will still keep the main character alive against all sense. Who, like, literally, WHO could not guess that Necromancer is Sauron? >Barrel Chase. Me: I thought the cow... I mean, the "goblin level" of the first movie was the most clinically stupid, unrealistic and ridiculous scene(well, together with stone giants), but this is something else. When you go mental, you go all the way down - I am afraid to watch 3rd part.\u000a\u000a>Smaug. I thought Transformers 3's "stupid wench tricking Megatron" was something that proved that Michael Bay is biased. No, Jackson has just redeemed Bay. Seriously, this silly CGI talking lizard hasn't fried Bilbo on sight, was flirting with him all along... and then hasn't killed a single dwarf before flying away in ragequit. Worst movie ending nominee. At least first movie's Bilbo-Gollum scene was a funny filler. This is just inexcusable CGI mashup with no sense or point at all, just to take screen time and show the dragon's moves.\u000a\u000a>Forge battle. Right, haven't any of them watched Alien Resurrection? You've gotta freeze the gold... Like, seriously, if this molten gold could not melt or simply incinerate Thorin swimming right on top of it... What was the point of bathing a whole "impenetrable" extra strong lizard in it? They expected him to melt? But, yeah, looks cool. Worst ending ever already achieved, so what gives, cheers for the looks.\u000a\u000aCopied and edit-censored from my post on another site.\u000a\u000aSo why give 7 stars to this? At least it's a Tolkien movie. And it has more action and plot escalation than the previous one. Render onto Ceasar that which is Ceasar's, so to say.

VAfter being pleasantly surprised by the first movie I was probably anticipating this movie a little more and in a way was somewhat let down. Where in the first movie Biblo seemed to dominate the action, in this film it seemed as if he had slipped a little further to the back and a number of other characters began to move to the front (such as Legolas, Tauriel, and Bard). Okay, Bilbo still plays an important role, but in a way it felt as if this film simply exists to tie the other two films together, and I am still struggling to understand how Peter Jackson is going to turn the third film into a full length feature. Mind you, if this film is anything to go by, I suspect I already know the answer to this one.\u000a\u000aThe reason I say this is because there are a couple of scenes in the movie that had somewhat been dragged out a little too much, and also that seemed to be a little obsolete. For instance, there is the scene where they are hurtling down the river in barrels and we have two of the elves running along the banks killing bucket loads of orcs. Mind you, in the book we do not actually have the Dwarfs being relentlessly pursued by the orcs (and also Legolas does not actually appear until the first book of Lord of the Rings). The other scene involved the fight with Smaug in the Lonely Mountain, particularly when they set up an elaborate trap to immerse him with gold. It seemed that this was going a little overboard, especially those of us who know that Smaug does not actually die in the Lonely Mountain. This, however, is left for the final movie.\u000a\u000aThis wasn't a bad movie, and Jackson has added a lot more to the story than was originally there. For instance the who situation in Laketown where the town is being run by a tyrant and has numerous spies out watching the population has been added to the film (as have the whole thing about the orcs). However he has also borrowed some of the story from Tolkien's other writings, such as the rise of the necromancer in Dul Gulder, as well as Radagast the Brown (who is mentioned in the stories but we do not actually encounter him). The thing about the Wind Lance is also an addition.\u000a\u000aOne of the themes that seems to run through this movie this is the idea of how greed is destructive. We see this in Thorin Oakenshield and we see this in the dragon as well. We all know what is going to happen to the dragon, and those of us who have read the book also know what is going to happen to Thorin. However, I will not spoil the ending here (though I may have already done so, but then this is why I marked this review as containing spoilers). What we don't know is how Peter Jackson is going to end it, though I suspect, based on the title of the third movie, that Biblo manages to get home.

VI honestly and truly love The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Peter Jackson was a miracle director that suddenly appeared to our collective consciousness and somehow managed to film three films that were pretty much all we had ever wanted from LotR films. All the characters felt just right, the visuals were absolutely gorgeous and Jackson had this gift for selecting just the right scenes and filming them in just the right way so that the films, long as though they were, never felt like they were either too long-winded or too hasty in order to cover more ground quickly. Of course not every decision Jackson made was the right call and there were some things that could have been done better, but as a whole they earned all the hype they received.\u000a\u000aAlas, it would seem that Jackson cannot repeat this feat a second time. The first Hobbit film wasn't yet so bad. True, the tone was at the same too goofy to function as a proper prequel to the LotR films, yet it was too dark for it really feel like they were adapting a children's book to the silver screen. Jackson tried for the middle road and in the process didn't fully please either of the camps. This same problem continues in the second Hobbit film, in which all of Jackson's worst tendencies from the previous films come back with vengeance. The adoration of elves above all else (I'm looking at you Legolas), his disdain for dwarfs (they're more than comic reliefs, you know) and overly choreographed fight scenes (there's really no tension in it when your first reaction is to laugh at just how absurd some of the fight moves are). And this time Jackson even covers some new ground by starting to skip over certain scenes that all fans had been waiting for in order for him to add in new non-canon content that wasn't wanted or needed. Admittedly some of it works, like the upgrade to the legend of Black Arrow, but some of it falls flat instantly, like the weird romance between an elf and a dwarf. I would have much preferred to spend more time with Beorn instead of spending a single minute with that study in awkwardness.\u000a\u000aAll that being said, I still can't deny that I didn't enjoy the heck out of this film. Most of the cast is still rock solid (McKellen, Freeman, Armitage are especially delightful to watch), the visuals are at worst just merely beautiful and at best they're mind-blowingly gorgeous. I was somewhat dreading the introduction of Smaug in this film, but he turned out okay. Not sure I understand why they with a wyvern-style design for him when the original Smaug in Tolkien's drawings clearly isn't one, but that's me nitpicking.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, the action scenes, while more than a bit silly and non-threatening, do look nice and are pleasant to follow. And as stated, some of the new additions are genuinely interesting and patch up some of the inconsistencies and flights of fantasy of the original book. It's a shame that we have to take all these good inventions with the bad ones.\u000a\u000aIs it worth watching? If you've liked the films so far, then sure, you'll get your fix of Middle-Earth from this. If you were dissatisfied with the first Hobbit film, this isn't going to change your mind.

VI'm really torn in two here with this movie. The fundamental mistake with The Hobbit trilogy is that it would have made an excellent single 3 hour movie; and therefore padding it out to three films has nothing to do with art and everything to do with money.\u000a\u000aThe 2nd film in the series, The Desolation of Smaug, has exactly the same faults as the first film. It's very good in spots, and then very stilted and overlong in other areas. A romance between a Dwarf and an Elf, which takes place here, merely serves to convince that Peter Jackson, having made vast amounts of cash from The Lord Of The Rings, cares little about the reaction of fans of Tolkien's work.\u000a\u000aI was able to enjoy it because I put the book completely out of my mind, some cannot and I sympathise completely with their view - give it a 1 or a 3 or whatever if you wish - I won't argue. But THERE IS enough good stuff here to keep you interested. Biggest problem is each good idea is dragged out beyond all reason and flogged to death.\u000a\u000aTauriel is not a bad character in herself, but Tolkien purists are going to go all JAR JAR on her. Jackson's idea to get her romantically linked to one of the dwarfs is just jaw droppingly bad. If that's all you can come up with Peter it might have been better to just leave it out.\u000a\u000aI liked Beorn and Mirkwood, which perhaps are dealt with too briefly, while Jackson frequently goes off on his flights of fancy which are nothing to do with the book. I also admired the Barrel Sequence, until it ran on too long, and ditto Smaug.\u000a\u000aAh, yes Smaug. Brilliantly realised, but the Erebor climax to the movie is way way too long. Might have been better to cut part of it (including the truly silly lighting of the furnaces) for an extended edition.\u000a\u000aThe movie is certainly better than a lot of other Hollywood product out there but the reasoning behind it is way too cynical. Still, better this than Avatar....

VThis is a very pretty film, and the 3D is pretty good - especially the bees. If you want to spend nearly three hours looking at great scenery and impressively realised sets, not to mention the scariest spiders ever, then this is the film for you. If you like dragons too all the more so.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand if you are looking for a story then you may be left wanting. Okay it is the middle one of three, but for quite startlingly long periods of the film nothing happens, or if it does happen, happens very slowly. Indeed. Or to put it another way, at one point - after the main characters had arrived in a village - I fell asleep. I woke up 10- 15 mins later and found I had missed (in terms of advancement of plot) absolutely nothing. At all.\u000a\u000aQuick summary. Film opens in a pub on the edge of The Shire. We discover one member of Bilbo's merry band has upset lots of people who all want him dead. Galdalf arrives. Threat averted.\u000a\u000aBilbo et al now start treking towards the mountain. Arrive a seriously dodgy wood (Mirkwood, but maybe McGuffin Wood would have been more appropriate). Obviously they have to go through it (one is strongly reminded of that classic book "We're Going on a Bear Hunt"... and then slightly horrified to think what Peter Jackson would come up with if he had the rights to that!). At this moment Gandalf leaves for no terribly good reason other than it needlessly puts the band of travelers in peril.\u000a\u000aThey enter said wood. This is actually quite a good bit. Admittedly the future (I nearly said "imminent", but that word has no place in a review of Hobbit 2) arrival of the spiders is telegraphed waaaaayyyyy ahead, and you kind of wonder what bunch of thickos would wander into a dark wood full of spider silk (and I mean full) without anyone actually saying "this white stuff... doesn't worry anyone a bit does it?"\u000a\u000aAnyway - big scary spiders appear. Mayhem. But no-one dies as a chap from Lord of the Rings shows up (with friend) and spiders leave.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile Gandalf has gone off to meet the Seventh Doctor. This is confusing as quite why Doctor Who is in Middle Earth, or where he has put his Tardis, is never explained and - although The Doctor accompanies Gandalf for a period - as soon as it gets remotely interesting Gandalf sends him away. As with much of the film this section is pretty but utterly pointless, plot-wise, but does fill a good 20 minutes or more of screen time. Gandalf now deals with a hornets' nest of nasty creatures by shaking said hornets nest and then bumping off large numbers of them, thus ensuring he is too late to meet up with Bilbo's Band as arranged.\u000a\u000aAfter some fun with Lord of the Rings guy's friends (who have taken against them) said Band have arrived in a town where Stephen Fry is king. As usual, Stephen Fry plays the part of Stephen Fry flawlessly. Nothing of any real significance happens for a long time.\u000a\u000aThey arrive at the mountain, and Bilbo is sent off to find a stone alone by his brave band. Finds the stone, plus a Smaug the Dragon, who has clearly been watching Goldfinger as - in a homage to every Bond villain throughout time - his proceeds to talk A LOT to Bilbo about... almost anything... thus allowing Bilbo to escape, rather than simply killing him immediately. Unless his first aim really was to talk Bilbo to death - because he does come pretty close. Again you wonder about how stupid a character can be as Bilbo's target is a stone shining out like a searchlight - but Smaug never seems to cotton on to this. \u000a\u000aAfter that... long, long battle between Smaug and Bilbo's band during which... no-one dies, not least because whenever anyone is at the Smaug's mercy he decides to talk to them instead of doing the proper dragonly thing.\u000a\u000aEventually everyone gets bored (or something) and Dragon flies off to attack Stephen Fry's village. Roll credits.\u000a\u000aSummary - a 160 minute film whose story could have been told in 60 minutes. Or less.

VLook, it gets 5 stars for being OK for what it is... it's just not the hobbit. \u000a\u000aI wanted to fall asleep during the last 15 mins, and I never do that in a film.\u000a\u000aI did like Gandalf facing the Necromancer in Dol Guldur, I did like some background bits, like him encouraging Thorin along in the inn at Bree. I did giggle when Bombur cut a swathe through the Orcs with the barrel, and then stuck his arms and legs out, but it could have easily done without. Or had that scene in some other way, eg, when they finally get out of the barrels. And where did the random spare barrel come from, as he jumps back in the water? Doesn't really matter, but...\u000a\u000aHowever, all the best bits have been left out. Again.\u000a\u000aIt has been destroyed... (oops, I mean adapted), for US cinema.\u000a\u000aGreat swathes of unnecessary complications, whilst taking out all the incidents that made the thing charming in the first place. Why is Fili wounded and left behind to be doctored by a meaningless elf maiden instead of going along? Why are any Dwarfs (I spelt dwarfs with a v...) left behind? Why all the 'song and dance' (figure of speech), with the Dragon chasing everyone about in the Mountain. It lost a lot of possible menace and atmosphere, there. Why a totally meaningless large gold statue of a dwarf that melts over Smaug. If it was trying to be a nod to the 'Alien' franchise, it missed completely. If it wasn't....????\u000a\u000aWhat happened to the sealed barrels? Bilbo nearly getting caught snitching the pie? The dwarf staggering out and saying he could eat anything for hours on end, but not an apple? Without these small touches, it loses so much. ''Thag you very buch''. \u000a\u000aAnd what's with the character assassinations?...again! Radagast was neither ridiculous, unintelligent, dirty nor cowardly as portrayed here. He was somewhat less worldly than the other wizards, and interested in animals. Think more along the lines of St Francis of Assisi, than dirty old tramp, like we got here. And why McCoy??? WHY??? So wrong. Unless you want a silly old duffer. Casting for random dingbat, yes. Casting for Wizard, no.\u000a\u000aThranduil wasn't quite as bad as all that, he just did what he saw fit to do and didn't enquire as far into it as he ought to have. He behaved rightly by his lights, and given the history between the wood elves and the dwarfs. Another character made worse.\u000a\u000aBard isn't quite as he's made to look here, either. And why is Bard's Black Arrow changed into the equivalent of a dragon lance? Why? For what purpose? It lends no excitement or interest to the story whatsoever. It's far MORE exciting to have one small man and his bow against a dragon than that giant bow-come-lance thrower contraption. Girion of Dale...More CA comin' your way, I say comin' your way!\u000a\u000aBeorn...looked like a man when in man shape...hairy - yes, yeti - no. And what happened to the introductions? And how Beorn was very pleased with them for killing the great goblin? (And thank heaven the goblins and orcs were more serious, and less like a vaudeville act crossed with comedy capers, as they were last time).\u000a\u000aBut seeing as we're at the lowest level possible, let's remain there. I was hoping I'd seen the last of 'racing sled-bunnies'. Yet here we are again, *sigh*. The 'buskies', as we call them at home, would be eaten by a random marauding Orc as soon as possible, if I had anything to do with it. \u000a\u000aLook it's absolutely fine if you've never read the books, a cheesy kiddy film, great.\u000a\u000aIt's just had the guts kicked out of what it was, for all the people that know and love the story. And it's SUCH a waste of talent and resources. The acting was really great, so where was the screenplay and story to match? Benedict Cumberbatch does a great job with the voices.\u000a\u000aI liked the LOTR trilogy, though I was really getting the poohs with it by the last one. This, I haven't liked much from the get go. It is a nice film, just not for me. I don't understand why you have to make up all this trash, when there is plenty of time-filler available in the book. I don't object to changing things at all - you have to for cinema, but this Hobbit thing has changed all the wrong things in all the wrong places so far as I can see. 'Lowest common denominator' language changes, useless story changes that distract rather than contribute. \u000a\u000aI wanted to see them have to carry the sleeping Bombur through the forest a bit. I did want to see the silly introduction to Beorn. I did want to see Bilbo teasing the spiders. I did want to see Bilbo trying to find enough straw to pack the Dwarfs in tightly. I did want to see a feast at Lake town where Bilbo has to make a speech while he's got a cold from being in the water so long, as he couldn't make shift to stay atop a barrel. I did want to see the intelligent birds at the Mountain... Roac son of Carc. I did want to see the dwarfs stumbling around disrupting the elvish revelries in the forest. \u000a\u000aDidn't.\u000a\u000aI gave it a go, and saw it, as people said it was better, but now I refuse to see the third one.\u000a\u000aI'd much rather Ralph Bakshi had finished it all, and done The Hobbit as well. I still watch his film, for all it's flaws, because it's far more loyal to the spirit of the thing.\u000a\u000aThe production was great.

VThe Dragon looks really good. For the rest, PJ's mindless destruction of a book which has sold 100,000,000+ copies continues. He really should have just called it "Legolas the Movie with a Dragon". Pretty much what he wanted to make. Indescribably bad on all levels. Even Ian M cannot save it!\u000a\u000a<---spoiler---> The Elf and dwarf love story is simply beyond belief. Desperate to eek out the book into 3 long movies, things have been added which not only detract from the original story but violate it. <---/spoiler--->\u000a\u000aAfter the 1st movie, Tolkien started spinning in his grave. I would imagine he is simply laughing now, because this series of movies is laughable.

VAfter watching various impressive trailers of the film, I expected great things from The Desolation of Smaug. And I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed.\u000a\u000aThis second film offers more thrills and adventure, and doesn't have the hour long intro. The action is intense right from the start and is paced brilliantly with dramatic scenes scattered throughout the 2 and a half hours running time; not impeding the progress of the story or the other segments of the film, instead, funnels it on – in exciting ways. But it doesn't just jump into them: the transitions between scenes work brilliantly with the superb cinematography — and often the patented sweeping long shots, which show off the spectacular places in which the film takes place perfectly. It's pretty much down to good directing by Peter Jackson.\u000a\u000aAnd, yes! The sets and all that! They were perfect. Mirkwood was… Perfect. Lake-town was… Perfect. And the lonely mountain itself? Perfect. And then there's the sound, and that's also fantastic.\u000a\u000aThe story flows fantastically with some great character development of characters that were very much side-lined in the first film: like Kili – with his interesting romantic side plot with Tauriel, a female elf, who seems a great addition to the film. However, some of the dwarfs were still left untouched in that department, just travelling with the rest of them, not really doing or saying anything of interest. Nevertheless, as a unit, the development is interesting: especially in the dragon scenes towards the end, where they act as heroes instead of the bumbling idiots they were portrayed as in the first film. But I'm not saying that was a bad thing given the slightly more comedic feel to the first film, I'm saying it's a good thing that they were not portrayed as 'bumbling idiots' in the second film because of the more melodramatic atmosphere it has.\u000a\u000aMost characters were portrayed brilliantly with great and expressive acting, for the most part keeping the characters true to the book (but tweaked when they needed to be). One actor that particularly stood out was, of course, Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins; alongside Ian Mckellen, Orlando Bloom and Luke Evans. Also, Richard Armitage's portrayal of Thorin was especially good, on par with Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn – which is a pretty impressive feet. But these performances all paled in significance to Benedict Cumberbatch's incredible voice acting as Smaug. It was brilliantly expressive and stylized, and fit my favourite dragon perfectly, giving him an additional menacing air. I honestly can't think of anything negative to say about it; it's truly awesome. Smaug really does steal the show; well, you'd want him to when he's the main advertising point of the film, in its title and the main focus of the film when it gets into the last hour and a half. Anyway! Benedict Cumberbatch, although I hate to say it, may well deserve the hype he gets (based on this performance, anyway).\u000a\u000aFurthermore, Luke Evans is fantastic as Bard: who is a fantastic character himself. Also, Steven Fry's appearance is completely fitting, giving his character's situation.\u000a\u000aAside from the characters and their portrayals; the visuals and the 3D of the film were nothing short of spectacular – some aspects even impressing me more than Gravity (and that was impressive!). Although, the CGI was a little overused at various points where models would have possibly served as the better choice – of course considering whether the use of models is realistic. The Lord of the Rings seemed to do a good job with it, anyway.\u000a\u000aOf course you're wondering: did it drag with its length like the first one? Well, it is a similarly long film, but doesn't really feel like it is; because of the stimulating action throughout and its fantastic pacing. So, yeah, it doesn't drag at all.\u000a\u000aThis film is obviously trying to be as good as The Lord of the Rings, and it is so agonizingly close to doing it; but that isn't the way I want to think about it, because no film in my mind can quite live up to the perfection of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. But this Hobbit film is pretty damn incredible.\u000a\u000aPS. The best parts of the film are in Mirkwood and scenes towards the end involving Smaug.\u000a\u000aVerdict:\u000a\u000aIn The Hobbit: the Desolation of Smaug, Smaug is the centerpiece of what is a fantastic thrill ride, with the perfect blend of action and narrative paced perfectly, helped by some superb acting and amazing cinematography. The only thing inherently wrong with this film I can think of is that it has a tad too much CGI; but, what the hell: it's a must see and definitely the best Hobbit film.\u000a\u000aSo I give it: 96/100.

VI was never a fan of the series and I'm not going to be now.\u000a\u000aThis is a 30 min story, squeezed into a 2.5-hours movie. As always with Peter Jackson, Technical side is excellent but the movie has no soul and it stretches endlessly with slow speeches and scenes that are cartoonish and endless (dinosaur chase, anyone?). Why is the barrel riding sequence better than the jungle scene in "Indiana Jones 4"?\u000a\u000aActually, I'm amazed that I saw the whole thing - obviously I fast forward a lot - since with the previous movie(s) I gave up after 20-30 min.\u000a\u000aI wasn't impressed by the barrel scene, which I heard great reviews about. The dragon "scene" was OK, but about 10 times the length it should have been.\u000a\u000aThe effects of putting "regular size" people together with dwarfs are amazing and completely seamless.
