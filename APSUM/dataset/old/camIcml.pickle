VFor $ 50 Dollars This Is A Prety Decent Camera ... It Evens Comes With A Case !
p2
aVHas A Zoom That 's Good For Amatuer Pictures ... Although if you are going with something a bit mroe professional I would suggest a different camera ... But i must sya it would be good for a person who has never used a zoom camera !
p3
aa(lp4
VBought this camera to replace the previous waterproof Fuji model .
p5
aVLike the styling of this P camera but the reflective nature of the screen makes shooting in sunlight difficult , Focus is iffy at best in several settings .
p6
aVHigh speed sport setting and the night settings were exceptional .
p7
aVA more responsive autofocus woulld make this an exceptional buy .
p8
aVI will return and spend a little more for better focus performance .

VOkay , I just purchased this DVD403 and with in 1 hour had the same problem with my lens cover that I have read about all too many times -LRB- should have read this before I purchased -RRB- .
p11
aVI was just about to break the cover off when I read one review that stated that this automatic cover is VERY SENSITIVE -LRB- too sensitive if you ask me -RRB- TO DUST .
p12
aVSo before breaking out the plyers or calling Sony -LRB- which I understand is useless and pricey -RRB- I decided to just pry open the cover and blow into this area to `` clean out '' and particles that might be in there .
p13
aVI honestly thought that this would not work but after 4 puffs I turned the camera on and THE CRAZY THING OPENED !!!
p14
aVI do not know how long it will continue to work nor do I know if this `` quick fix '' will work again but I thought that I would put this out there for anyone to try BEFORE dropping even more cash into the camera or trashing it altogether .
p15
aVI sure hope that this helps and more so I hope that it will continue to fix the problem when it arises .
p16
aVSony really needs to get their act together in regards to this .
p17
aVI mean uncovering a lens is a small function and they can not get that right ?
p18
aVCome on Sony , step it up !
p19
aa(lp20
VI purchased this for a Christmas present for my grandson .
p21
aVI do not know if it works well , but he loves it .
p22
aa(lp23
VThe camera was open when i received it .
p24
aVThere was a HUGE Scratch on the lens cover making picture taking impossible .
p25
aVThere were already 3 pictures taken on the camera when i received it .
p26
aVI order the same camera from another company it it worked great .
p27
aVThe product is great the company is cheap .
p28
aa(lp29
VDo n't even bother with this camera , it was nice and worked good for about 3 days and after that it started slowing down .
p30
aVIt would take the pic and then take like 10 seconds to show on the screen , and since it has gotten slower and slower .
p31
aVNow I was just taking pictures and the pic never popped up on screen , and it wo n't shut off turn on or anything .
p32
aVIt has brand new batteries and has barely been used , I tried changing batteries and everything .
p33
aVThe lens is now stuck out wo n't turn on or off .
p34
aVComplete crap DO N'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY
p35
aa(lp36
VI researched point  shoot 35mm cameras thoroughly , and the Pentax IQZoom 120Mi was the obvious choice for what I needed .
p37
aVI compared Canon , Fuji , Minolta , Nikon and Olympus models , as well as Pentax .
p38
aVI was replacing a 1989 model Pentax IQZoom 900 - 38-90mm , that was simply too big , and took 2 lithium batteries .
p39
aV-LRB- It still works flawlessly , and takes great photos . -RRB-
p40
aVI needed the best small zoom camera for the money .
p41
aVI am far from a professional photographer , and I do n't take photos every week .
p42
aVI am just an average photographer who likes to know that whatever the situation , I can get great photos .
p43
aVThe best features of the new camera include : the small overall size - but with big enough to use operational buttons , metal case , the illuminated -LRB- at night -RRB- LCD panel , the great zoom lens and viewfinder , easy to use shooting and flash modes , and simplicity of overall use .
p44
aVEven my wife , who hates to even try a new camera , is very impressed with this one .
p45
aVShe has a Pentax IQZoom60s , and finds the 120 just as easy to use .
p46
aVMy test roll of ASA 200 film worked great in both indoor low light flash and outdoor , bright light situations , including backlight - where the fill-in flash works automatically .
p47
aVI do think that I will use ASA 400 film most of the time , as it is more versatile .
p48
aVThat is what Pentax recommends on their web site .
p49
aV... I have also owned Nikon , Minolta and Olympus cameras ; but Pentax has by far the best features for the price .
p50
aVIt also has one of the best reliability ratings .
p51
aV... I look forward to as many years of good photos as I have gotten from the old Pentax .
p52
aVBuy one of the IQZoom 120 Mi 's - you will love it !
p53
aa(lp54
VThe camera works great , except that , when moved , the lens `` rattled . ''
p55
aVIt seems it did dot affect its performance at this time , but did not want to take any chances and had to return it .
p56
aVToo bad : I always expect the best from Sony , but , no more ...
p57
aa(lp58
VI bought mine from a different website , but since I have been a long time customer and user of of Amazon.com website , I thought of giving this review to aid other customers old and new .
p59
aVI have this mini cam for about a month now and I used it when I vacationed in California just last month .
p60
aVI never regret buying it .
p61
aVMy family and friends have a great time watching our pictures on TV everytime we return from one of our siteseeing trips .
p62
aVI just give it a four star for now because I still have not use all it 's features yet .
p63
aVThere 's just too many to read and install in order for me to fully utilize it .
p64
aVOverall , I think I got my money 's worth .
p65
aVIt 's convenient and easy to use -LRB- the still and video cam only -RRB- .
p66
aVIt can get great pictures , and you can use the auto flash if the lighting is not good .
p67
aVThe LCD monitor is not so clear on a bright day , but who 's complaining , just delete your not so good shots and just keep the best .
p68
aVI have n't used the viewfinder that much since even in 35mm camera I find the viewfinder too small , I used the LCD most of the time .
p69
aVYou just need to buy additional battery , which I did .
p70
aVI bought the BNV840 before but it weighs just the same as the camera itself , so I end up exchanging it with BNV312 .
p71
aVPlus the former one needs a different charger which I have to buy separately .
p72
aVI will definitely recomend this with anyone .
p73
aVAlso I bought a 128mb SD memory card in addition to the 8md that is included in the video package , though I have n't used up my 8mb yet .
p74
aa(lp75
VThe photos produced by this camera have unusually poor contrast and unusually high noise level , even at low ISO .
p76
aVI took this camera on a trip where my friend was shooting pretty much same scenery with Canon SD800 under the same lighting conditions , yet the difference in quality is striking , almost every photo I took with XP10 went straight to trashcan .
p77
aVBTW , I am quite experienced with digital photography , over the last 10 years owned 5 P and 3 SLRs - I know how to use cameras and what to expect from them .
p78
aVThe picture quality , IMO , is enough to strike this camera off anybody 's wishlist , yet this does n't end the list of problems : 1 -RRB- Camera has exceptionally long shutter lag .
p79
aVI do n't know how to measure it precisely , but it seems like a whole second , maybe more , passes after you press the button and before camera finally snaps a photo .
p80
aV2 -RRB- LCD monitor is impossible to use on the sunny day - it 's a nearly perfect mirror , as you try to compose the photo all you can see is the reflection of your own frustrated face .
p81
aV3 -RRB- Buttons are poorly placed - as you hold the camera , the palm of your hand is pressing against super-sensitive control buttons and as you press the shutter , it 's the other buttons that get inadvertently pressed - instead of taking a photo , camera switches to a different mode .
p82
aV4 -RRB- waterproof - did n't test it personally , but beware : the manual states that to maintain waterproofness you are supposed to replace rubber parts every year or so .
p83
aVThis sounds like too much hassle and additional expense .
p84
aVI used to own Pentax waterproof P in the past - it was maintenance-free .
p85
aV5 -RRB- The lens is uncovered - for a camera that supposedly designed to withstand abuse , this is a risky design decision .
p86
aVI 'd think that uncovered lens would get scratched soon .
p87
aV6 -RRB- The video quality turned out to be as bad as picture quality if not worse .
p88
aVWhen trying to shoot a clip in low-light conditions I got back basically a black screen .
p89
aa(lp90
VSent it back , easy to set up for local use and worked good , but after 24 hours over a period of about 5 days of messing with it for remote use , never could get it going , my next one will definitely be plug and play .
p91
aVI 've got over twenty years computer experience and can generaly follow instructions fairly well , but the instruction booklet and small print , you need a magnifier to read and then not sure , is terrible .
p92
aa(lp93
VThis camera is fantastic .
p94
aVIt is loaded with features , but a few of my favorites are : - the viewfinder , what you see is what you get , the view is 100 % , no guesstimating about what is going to or not going to appear in the image .
p95
aVWhat you see is what you get .
p96
aV- solid build , the metal body has a great feel yet not too heavy - the quick view feature allows for complete central control of the shooting functions with a minimum of wasting time fiddling with menus or buttons - the battery life is excellent , I have two and that is enough for hundreds of shots I could go on and on , I have been using this camera for almost a year and I can not say enough good things about it .
p97
aa(lp98
VMy thanks for the quick shipping and very helpful instruction letter that came with camera .
p99
aVWould like to find another one of these Kodak C330 cameras in very good shape .
p100
aVGene

aa(lp102
VA lot of people have reported problems with the E-Dial and the buttons in general -LRB- Ex : .
p103
aVI have sent mine in for repair once for this same issue and I still have to keep spraying contact cleaners into the dial whenever it gets a little hot -LRB- 80F + -RRB- and humid .
p104
aVThe camera is fantastic otherwise , but by the build quality just seems like they wanted to make a $ 10 toy camera .
p105
aa(lp106
VThese binoculars are high grade , made well and have a great case they come with .
p107
aVProblem is , the higher you go , the more `` shake '' there is , to the things you 're trying to see .
p108
aVLower settings work very nicely , but unless you 're as steady as a tripod ... you will get `` shakey '' viewing .
p109
aa(lp110
VI bought 6 of these for students to use in a photoshop class .
p111
aVThey are good `` kid proof '' cameras .
p112
aVThe only drawback is that the USB is inside the battery\u005c/SD card compartment .
p113
aVWith it being a waterproof camera I can see this as a necessity .
p114
aVI teach in the northwest with lots of rain so the waterproof feature is good .
p115
aVI do n't plan on going under water with them but with studen t sue this is a good feature .
p116
aVSo far they work great .

VI LOVE NIKON PRODUCTS THIS Nikon D3100 14.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f\u005c/3 .5 -5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens , by Nikon I HAVE NEVER USED IT BUT A FRIEND OF MY TESTED AND LOVED IT .
p119
aa(lp120
VI purchased this Camera from Amazon last year and now when I have just few days of warranty left , I have this Lens Cap error coming on my camcorder .
p121
aVI am not sure how JVC is going to resolve it and whether they would ask for any money for it or not ... but certainly I am not going to buy any JVC camera any more ... this is a junk ... I had written my review earlier before talking to customer service .
p122
aVBut now after talking them I have more bitterness for JVC .
p123
aVOn the phone customer service told me that they would service this problem for free and I just need to send the camcorder to them at their factory location .
p124
aVI drove down to their factory location at Aurora IL and was very surprised to find out that the person at reception told me that this camera is not covered under their program and hence I would have to pay for the repair .
p125
aVI told her that the customer service told me that they would repair it for free as this is a known problme .
p126
aVBut after lot of arguments and calling to customer service from reception itself they told me that they would do it for free .
p127
aVNow after two days they called me and told that only assessment of expenditure would be free but I would still have to pay for repair for this garbage .
p128
aVI am totally pissed off the way these guys are treating their customers .
p129
aVCertainly there should be class suit against them .
p130
aVI do n't know how I would even get my defective garbage from them at all .
p131
aVCan any body here guide all of us how to make JVC pay for their defective products .
p132
aa(lp133
VI purchased this camera because it came highly recommended as Tough , Combat Resistant , Easy to use , That takes GOOD PICTURES .
p134
aVAfter receiving the camera , he told me the ONLY Problem had to do with the charger receptical on the camera or the charger plug .
p135
aVI 'm going to have to buy him a 110 vac charger so he can carry the camera on his patrols .
p136
aVMarineDad
p137
aa(lp138
VIt 's a great time to be buying a 10 megapixel SLR , as all the top manufacturer 's have new , 5-star models .
p139
aVSo let 's examine : What do we want most ?
p140
aVGreat photos , a well made camera , and features that will let us achieve our photographic goals .
p141
aVThe K10D delivers .
p142
aVAll the top contenders will deliver excellent results that can be made into poster size prints with great color and detail .
p143
aVAlthough we can point so some shortcomings -LRB- like the poor performance of the Sony Alpha 100 at ISO 1600 -RRB- , image quality is something that is still in the eye of the beholder .
p144
aVHowever , features are features , and the K10D has loads .
p145
aVThe first thing you 'll notice is the solid feel in your hands .
p146
aVIt feels robust , and the shutter has been tested to 100,000 shots -LRB- same as Canon 's bigger brother 30D -RRB- .
p147
aVBut to this , we add something else not found in any other camera in the class : weather-proofing .
p148
aVThe body contains 72 seals to help keep dust , dirt and moisture on the outside -LRB- the optional grip has 38 seals -RRB- .
p149
aVWhen you put on the optional grip , it really does feel like a part of the camera , not a wiggly thing that might come off .
p150
aVTo get those great photos , the K10D has all the standard feature set , plus a few new ones -LRB- like `` sensitivity '' mode -RRB- , which will come in hand for some people , but of more partical use to many will be the ability to define what `` Auto ISO '' range the camera can use .
p151
aVWant the camera to be able to use 1600 ?
p152
aVDone .
p153
aVPentax 's metering systems have always been well thought of , but you 'll get center-weighted and spot metering as options , too .
p154
aVTheir `` digital preview '' can be very handy in setting up the proper white balance .
p155
aVThe viewfinder is the largest in it 's class -LRB- although the D80 is the smallest fraction behind -RRB- .
p156
aVWhen viewing through it , you 'll see the 11-point autofocus .
p157
aVWhat you do n't see is that the nine central segments are `` cross basis '' points , meaning they focus on both vertical and horizontal lines .
p158
aVThe other competitors simply have one , the center segment , that is cross-basis .
p159
aVThis may not help it focus faster , but it should improve accuracy .
p160
aVAdditionally , the focusing mode is easy to change .
p161
aVA switch up front allows you to select manual , single or continuous autofocusing , while a dial on back allows you to change from spot focus -LRB- only the center zone -RRB- , wide -LRB- allows the camera to select -RRB- or free-floating -LRB- you select any of the eleven zones , and can change it quickly with the key-pad on the back of the camera -RRB- .
p162
aVThe choice of the SD\u005c/SDHC cards is great .
p163
aVThis small cards avoid the dreaded `` bent pin '' issue of the compact flash cards , and the SD are compatible with a hugh number of compact cameras as well .
p164
aVAnother nice touch is the optional remote control .
p165
aVIt can trigger the camera from the front AND from BEHIND the camera , and can store inside the optional grip .
p166
aVI also love the fact they included the .
p167
aVdng standard for RAW images , as this is an open standard developed by Adobe .
p168
aVAnd there is one feature that Pentax now leads : Shake Reduction -LRB- or VR , or IS , or SteadyShot -RRB- .
p169
aVFirst , like the Sony , the SR is built into the camera .
p170
aVSo for a modest cost up front , ALL your lenses get some stabalization ... even older manual focus lenses !
p171
aVAnd as a side benefit , you get a slight benefit in keeping the sensor clean .
p172
aVBut what most people do n't understand about Pentax SR system is that it is a THREE AXIS anti-shake system , something that no other maker offers .
p173
aVIn-lens , or the Sony rail system , compensate for you shaking left\u005c/right  up\u005c/done .
p174
aVBy combine these two , it compensates for diagonally , too .
p175
aVWhat they do not compentate is for `` rotational '' shake .
p176
aVImagine a line running through the camera lens to the subject , rotating the camera around this axis .
p177
aVThe Pentax SR system uses magnets and bearings to allow the sensor to free float compared to the body .
p178
aVTremendous technology .
p179
aVPentax has been a bit light on their lens selection , but keep in mind that this uses every Pentax 35mm lens ever made , and 3 exciting new lenses that they recently announced -LRB- 16-50 f2 .8 ; 50-135 f2 .8 ; and 60-250 f4 .0 , all weather sealed with ultrasonic motors -RRB- make them very competitive .
p180
aVFor a first lens , the 18-55 is hard to beat .
p181
aVIt 's well made , featuring a metal lens mount , and the internal focusing allows for easier use of filters and a more efficient , included , lens hood .
p182
aVBuy the Canon XTi , Nikon D80 or Sony Alpha 100 , and you 'll get a terrific camera .
p183
aVBut for my money -LRB- yes , I did buy one -RRB- , the Pentax K10D is the best .
p184
aa(lp185
VBought this camera to replace our beloved FinePix S700 which was accidentally broken by a loved one after 4 yrs of constant use .
p186
aVTook the Fujifilm FinePix S1800 camera out of the box and immediately noticed how cheaply it was made .
p187
aVThe thin plastic exterior is bubbled and screams cheap .
p188
aVBut , I could get past looks if it took good quality pictures .
p189
aVIt did not .
p190
aVThe screen images were grainy with weird yellow\u005c/orange colors and the pictures we took were mostly all blurry .
p191
aVThe video quality looked like a 1970 's video , grainy and slow upon playback .
p192
aVYou could hear the camera zooming in and out during playback .
p193
aVSadly , it ruined some memorable moments we tried to capture on film .
p194
aVAnother drawback is that you have to pop up the flash manually !
p195
aVIt does n't pop up automatically when the lighting warrants .
p196
aVFrustrating to say the least .
p197
aVAfter reading other bad reviews , I realize that it 's hit and miss with this camera as there are lemons being produced and unfortunately , we received one of them .
p198
aVWe returned it to Amazon for a full refund -LRB- which was an easy process thankfully -RRB- .
p199
aVYou can take your chances with this camera , but I would not recommend it .
p200
aa(lp201
VThis cute machine which has the option of front and back viewing , I found the camera itself easy to use , great for travel ; although , not being very computer literate , the downloading , blogging , burning took me awhile to do .
p202
aVThe unit holds few controls , on\u005c/off , menu , light -LRB- which is fairly bright -RRB- , port for the computer which pops out from the side -LRB- they also include a short , extension wire to help -RRB- , the front\u005c/back viewing .
p203
aVIt states about 30 minutes of contiuous filming ; one can , of course , can shoot photos .
p204
aVThere are 3 pixel settings for various situations .
p205
aVI think the images are quite sharp , and the playback and volume fine .
p206
aVOne needs to load an outside social site or use Sony 's to do the blogging .
p207
aVThere 's lot of instruction which can be downloaded .
p208
aVI struggled with them .
p209
aVI 'm more of a follow the dots , go from 1-10 , outlined kind of learner .
p210
aVI do n't know , maybe it 's just me , but I had to review the instruction frequently .
p211
aVOverall , I like it , and have traveled , hiked , shot from home , indoors and outdoors , and the machine has held up .
p212
aVNow the question is , is it worth the price and now with our I-phones doing so much , is it still pertinent .
p213
aVEither way , I 'm going to make use of it .
p214
aa(lp215
VI do n't want to say this is a bad telescope , because it gets the job done , but I can honestly say this was nothing like what I expected .
p216
aVMy biggest complaint is that -LRB- unless I 'm doing something TERRIBLY wrong -RRB- the pictures of Jupiter on the Amazon site are very misleading .
p217
aVIf you expect to be able to see images like that , you are going to be as disappointed as I was .
p218
aVJupiter looks like a tiny white star , as does just about every other planet I try to look at .
p219
aVIt 's still cool to look at , and you can make out the two moons -LRB- as two tinier dots -RRB- , but it does n't look anything like those pictures .
p220
aVThe only really cool planet to look at is Saturn , because you can see the rings , but it 's still a tiny thing .
p221
aVOther than that , the SkyAlign feature has n't worked very well for me either .
p222
aVI would line up three bright stars -LRB- or two and the moon -RRB- , it would say it was aligned , but then it would never point at the right thing .
p223
aVThis could be user error , though , as I do n't see many complaints about this .
p224
aVIf you want to look at the moon , this thing is great !
p225
aVYou can really make out the craters and everything .
p226
aVIt 's also good for just general star gazing .
p227
aVThis is my first telescope , so it 's entirely possible that my complaints are just inexperience .
p228
aVIt 's just for $ 500 I expected a much better view of the planets than what I got .
p229
aVOne last thing I 'll throw out there is that the camera attachment -LRB- sold separately -RRB- does n't seem to work to well either .
p230
aVI actually got better pictures with my iPhone through the lens piece than I did with a Nikon D5000 using the attachment .
p231
aVIf I 'm doing something wrong with this telescope , then PLEASE someone let me know and I 'll happily change my review .
p232
aa(lp233
VI love this little scope .
p234
aVGreat for shooting , bird watching and just checking things out .
p235
aVDoes need a bit of light to see things , but it is crisp and effective .
p236
aVIt 's smaller than the picture makes it look , but you 'll need a fairly good tripod .
p237
aVHave n't tried it but seeing my shot pattern at even 200 yards should be easy .
p238
aVI recommend it .
p239
aVMight just sell my 6 '' Starhopper Celestron telescope and use this .
p240
aVIt 's kind of a PITA to use and colimate .
p241
aVI think this one is effective down to a 12.5 mm eyepiece .
p242
aVThe 6 and 2.5 mm are pretty useless on this unit .
p243
aVThe 25mm is good too .
p244
aVThis comes with a 32mm - bit wider field and it seems to be pretty bright and clear .
p245
aa(lp246
VI needed a new digital camera fast in order to beat the deadline for an online video contest recently .
p247
aVPreviously I had owned the Kodak EasyShare Z1275 model which cost me just under $ 200 three years ago .
p248
aVMoney was tight and so I did n't want to spend that kind of cash .
p249
aVSo I decided between two models : this one and another Kodak EasyShare listed at $ 104 .
p250
aVIn the end I went with this model , the C142 and I shudder to think if I had n't .
p251
aVThis little camera with the small price just blew me away .
p252
aVNot only does it take high quality video but the pictures are even better than my old Kodak $ 200 model !
p253
aVI was n't expecting that .
p254
aVThe photos this camera takes are absolutely gorgeous !
p255
aVEven if you take a shot of your garbage can the picture is gorgeous !!
p256
aVThe camera takes double AA batteries , has a thingie on the bottom for mounting a tripod on , a beautiful LCD screen to view your pictures and video with , a slot for an SD card , a flash , a self-timer that goes up to 10 seconds , auto focus , a review of all your shots , and best of all a feature that allows you to easily share\u005c/transfer your pictures and videos to YouTube and other social networking sites -LRB- Facebook I think -RRB- .
p257
aVEmail as well I believe .
p258
aVOn screen directions are in various languages when you first turn your camera on , there 's a time and date stamp , and much more .
p259
aVWhen you 're ready to transfer your photos and videos to your computer all you do is plug it in using the USB cable\u005c/plug that comes with it and instantly the software appears on your screen for use .
p260
aVThere is no software disc included -- it 's already in the camera every time you transfer .
p261
aVAn important note .
p262
aVYou will need QuickTime to view your videos after they 're transfered .
p263
aVAnd , yes , sound is included on your video but only available on playback .
p264
aVThe camera has no speaker .
p265
aVVolume is adjustable but I find it to be just right .
p266
aVGreat sound !
p267
aVHow Kodak can afford to put out a digital camera like this with such a small price tag is beyond me .
p268
aVBut I have one and that 's all that matters .
p269
aVI got the blue color and it looks like a much more expensive camera .
p270
aVI wish I could afford to buy another one as I would just give it away to my favorite person .
p271
aVYou wo n't be disappointed with this baby .
p272
aVI highly recommend !
p273
aa(lp274
VWe liked the camera in many ways but found it too difficult to use with the very small buttons .
p275
aVThis camera could be great if this feature improves .
p276
aa(lp277
VI really liked this camera -- until the shutter froze .
p278
aVTwice .
p279
aVFrom what I can tell , it 's junk in VERY cold weather .
p280
aVI shoot in cold weather a lot and I used this camera on an extended trip through Canada .
p281
aVI took the E-PM1 outside often in temperatures between 20 above and 20 below zero Fahrenheit .
p282
aVOther cameras that I own or have owned , -LRB- Canon 5D Mark II , G9 , S90 , and Panasonic GF1 -RRB- have not had a problem in cold temperatures , even doing long exposure shots at 40 below zero .
p283
aVSure , their battery capacity sucks when its that cold , but the cameras otherwise functions perfectly .
p284
aVNot the E-PM1 .
p285
aVWhen shooting in cold weather , the shutter locked down .
p286
aVI had to mail it into Olympus .
p287
aVFour weeks later I received it back with a brand new shutter .
p288
aVBut a week later the shutter froze AGAIN .
p289
aVOne bad shutter is a lemon .
p290
aVBut two bad shutters means this camera has a problem .
p291
aVNot only does it not work in freezing temperatures , but it becomes a brick that sure better be under warranty .
p292
aVSo if you live north of Portland , OR , be warned .
p293
aVThis thing may crap out on you when outside in winter .
p294
aVIf I lived in Florida I 'd get this thing again in a heartbeat .

VI was looking for a slim but feature rich quality camera .
p297
aVI have had canon 's in the past but wanted to try something different .
p298
aVAt first I bought a Samsung but it proved to be a bit too bulky .
p299
aVSo far we love the canon my only complaint is that sometimes when shooting video it goes out of focus .
p300
aVno idea why .
p301
aa(lp302
VCant get a better pair of binoculars for the money .
p303
aVVery satisfied with the quality of the product .
p304
aVThey are a little heavy but they are not to heavy for what I use them for .
p305
aa(lp306
VI 've gotten this camera to replace a Canon S45 that I bought in January 2003 and this review is meant as a contrast to that type of camera -LRB- i.e. , this review may not be too useful if you 're coming to this camera from another point of view -RRB- .
p307
aVI chose the S45 at the time over the top ELPH model back then -LRB- S330 , I think -RRB- because I expected that it would be my only camera for a while and so wanted manual control , RAW support , etc. .
p308
aVAs it happens , the Digital Rebel came out in September that year and when I got one , the role of my S45 changed : A take-anywhere camera for taking snapshots and video clips .
p309
aVThe latter came a bit as a surprise , because I thought I 'd prefer using my more full-featured miniDV-based video camera .
p310
aVHowever , it turns out that `` compact '' often beats `` full-featured '' -LRB- the S45 is not as small as the SD800 , but it 's still pretty small compared to my video camera -RRB- .
p311
aVIn its new role , the weaknesses of the S45 were -LRB- a -RRB- not compact enough , -LRB- b -RRB- poor low-light performance , -LRB- c -RRB- limited , low-quality movie recording functionality , -LRB- d -RRB- relative slow response times .
p312
aV-LRB- That 's all relative , of course : At the time , it was a reasonably good compromise in those areas . -RRB-
p313
aVOn the plus side , the S45 is sturdy , I really like its user interface , and I got some really nice pictures out of it .
p314
aVHow does the SD800 stack up in that context ?
p315
aVVery well , but not perfectly .
p316
aVI like its build quality and the subcompact size -LRB- though it 's a bit on the large end of its class ; not a bad thing per se -RRB- .
p317
aVThe plastic parts are no worse than the similar parts on the S45 , but I get slightly anxious at the thought of scratching the shiny surfaces .
p318
aVThe 2.5 '' screen make for bright and sharp previews -LRB- it feels more fragile than that of the S45 , however -RRB- .
p319
aVImage quality is a step above that of the S45 in general , and easily two steps above for low-light work -LRB- where the image stabilization function and better ISO 400 performance really shine -RRB- .
p320
aVISO800 seems somewhat usable , beyond my expectation .
p321
aVI do n't care much about some of the more exotic features like `` swap colors '' , but one feature I 've unexpectedly come to appreciate is the face-recognition contribution to focus and exposure : It works , and it works really well !
p322
aV-LRB- It also ties into a built-in categorization feature , in that the label `` People '' will automatically be assigned to pictures containing faces ; that 's clever too , but I do n't think I 'll use it . -RRB-
p323
aVUnsurprisingly , the wider-angle lens is a boon to many snapshot situations .
p324
aV-LRB- It was one of the factors that prompted me to order the SD800 . -RRB-
p325
aVThere is considerable corner softness at the wider end , but for this type of camera it does n't bother me too much .
p326
aVI wish the long end were a little longer of course -LRB- and slightly less compact models from Panasonic do better in this regard -RRB- , but again I do n't feel strongly about that considering the camera 's size .
p327
aVThis also appears to be one the most responsive subcompacts out there : It 's certainly a whole lot faster at starting up and zooming than the S45 -LRB- though it still feels sluggish compared to a DSLR -RRB- .
p328
aVThe movie clip recording mode is far better than that of the S45 : The higher -LRB- VGA -RRB- resolution and the image stabilization are the main factors there .
p329
aVStill , I wish it could record a using a tighter codec -LRB- like H. 264 -RRB- and I wish the optical zoom could be used during shooting .
p330
aVA 1GB SD card will hold a little over 8 minutes of 640x480 30fps video , but once downloaded I can convert that to a H. 264 file of about 70MB .
p331
aVThe digital zoom in movie mode works well in good light -LRB- almost 5X for 640x480 clips -RRB- , but in low light zooming in more than 3x or so results in exceptionally pixel-noisy clips .
p332
aVFinally , the overall interface is relatively intuitive and generally well executed .
p333
aVMy one beef is that `` review '' mode is part of the general mode dial .
p334
aVOn the S45 -LRB- and Canon 's DSLRs -RRB- , `` review '' is entered using a separate switch -LRB- or button -RRB- , which allows the general dial to indicate the recording mode : A half-press on the shutter and the immediately goes back to recording mode .
p335
aVOn the SD800 , if I 'm reviewing images and suddenly see an opportunity -LRB- which happens all the time -RRB- , I have to first fumble with the dial -LRB- being careful to select the right mode -RRB- and only then is the camera ready to shoot .
p336
aVOn the plus side , when shooting a picture the camera automatically displays the image shot for a customizable amount of time -LRB- I set it to `` until shutter pressed '' -RRB- and allows zooming into that picture .
p337
aa(lp338

aa(lp346
VWell , I 've owned this camera for two days now .
p347
aVI read all the reviews and was forewarned about the difficulty with the battery closure .
p348
aVYes , it 's tough to close , but if you press hard enough on the little door , it 's easy to push the slider over .
p349
aVThis is more of an emotional review , of gratitude and excitement !
p350
aVAs an artist , I like to paint on site , and want to take good pictures to refer to once I 'm back in my studio .
p351
aVI also sell on line -LRB- ebay -RRB- and blog , both which require high quality pics .
p352
aVBut , I am so not a camera person !
p353
aVThe ease of the intelligent point and shoot has made me feel like I am a photographer !
p354
aVI just wish I had it last month on my trip to Yosemite and Bodega Bay .
p355
aVI spent time this morning taking pictures of the flowers in my garden ... and I 'm amazed and thrilled at the clarity !
p356
aVyou can see them on my blog : -LRB- ... -RRB- I had wanted a slim camera to slide into my pocket or art supply bag for taking pictures on site -LRB- like Yosemite , beaches , etc. -RRB- So I deeply considered the extra weight and bulk of this jewel .
p357
aVIt was the incredible zoom quality that convinced me .
p358
aVAnd I 'm really happy about being able to zoom in from a distance to capture the tiniest details ... important to an artist !
p359
aVI am really , really happy with this camera !!

VThis little Gem was the answer to my Video Prayers .
p362
aVI wanted to purchase an action camera for my cycle riding videos but did not want to pay a huge price for a Go Pro or something similar just yet .
p363
aVThis camera gets some of the best Non-HD video I have seen .
p364
aVIt does have a quirky way that you have to dislodge the camera if mounted on its right hand side but after some practice its a snap .
p365
aVYou cant go wrong with this camera if you want some action video without busting your budget .
p366
aVMakes a great entry level camera until you can graduate to HD .
p367
aVThe MIC on this baby is very sensitive so you may have to baffle it for wind noise .
p368
aVAlso you will not be using this camera at night and to get the very best video possible use in full daylight .
p369
aVI like it so much I purchased a second one !
p370
aa(lp371
VI 'm not going to repeat everything the other reviewers said , just emphasize that this little camera can take 3 minute long movies at 320x240 resolution , which when viewed on a TV come out amazingly sharp and fluid with fairly good sound .

aVAlthough my computer is 6 mos .

aVold and meets the specs for buying the 3rd generation camera , not only would it not complete the compression process for emailing a video to friends , the process froze my computer necessitating a forced shutdown .

p395
aVOf course , I was the only one that had this problem .

VI decided to treat myself to some really good birding binoculars after my husband forked over a ton of $ $ $ at REI for a backpacking tent , backpack , and new sleeping bag for himself - oh and a camping towel .
p400
aVAt first I was ready to send these 8x42 Monarchs back as I could not site properly with them .
p401
aVI am left-eye dominant and found that I was only seeing an image in the left lens while the right showed black .
p402
aVI find that in order to see the image in both lenses at the same time , I have to adjust the way I view through them .
p403
aVI ca n't have the lens rims touching around my eyes and I have to hold the binoculars slightly farther from my left eye than my right .
p404
aVAfter I played with them a while and figured this out , I was in awe of what I saw .
p405
aVI 've used a cheapo Tasco set for decades , mostly to look at birds , and did n't know binoculars could be this good .
p406
aVThe clarity of the view is amazing and I am thrilled .
p407
aVThe drawbacks are that these are heavier than I would have liked since I also have a camera hanging around my neck when I 'm out hiking .
p408
aVAlso , the eyepiece caps are pretty much useless .
p409
aVStill , the view alone is worth 5 stars .
p410

Vhi , I purchased this camera last week .
p412
aVIt has great result .
p413
aVOnly problem i m facing with this camera is when i transfer it to cd image quality gets detoriate .
p414
aValso its shaky .
p415
aVIs there any way to improve video quality .
p416
aa(lp417
VFirst , I did not buy this for video .
p418
aVI am a photographer .
p419
aVIf video was my main concern then I would have bought a video camera .
p420
aVThe rolling shutter issue commonly mentioned does happen but only when moving or shaking the camera so fast it would make anyone watching the video dizzy or sick .
p421
aVI have played with the video for the fun of it and non of the videos have had the rolling shutter issue so I really do n't think it is much of a problem .
p422
aVI would like to see video dropped so that real useful functions can be added like built-in GPS , voice memos , and built-in wireless data transfer just to name a few .
p423
aVWithout getting long winded in trying to explain every technical detail I can tell you that this camera will offer incredible creative control .
p424
aVMy D300s replaced a D200 and I am in awe at the improvements the D300s has over the D200 .
p425
aVThe two cameras are not even a close comparison .
p426
aVThe D300s is faster in every category and has great high iso noise reduction , especially for a DX sized sensor .
p427
aVI shoot a lot of winter sports and the D300s has great battery life in cold weather .
p428
aVI am also happy with how quick and accurate the autofocus tracks a fast moving subject .
p429
aVI should mention though that autofocus is noticeably slower when using a Sigma or Tamron lens .
p430
aVThe Nikon lenses are lightning fast .
p431
aVAll the controls are logically placed and understandable .
p432
aVThe menu is incredibly easy to navigate .
p433
aVI especially like how well you can customize nearly every button on the camera to do what ever suits your needs .
p434
aVAnother feature I like is how well it controls multiple flash units .
p435
aVThis handles the Nikon Creative Lighting System with precision .
p436
aVI could keep rambling on about how much I am enjoying the D300s but I am tired and will stop here .
p437
aVI would highly recommend this camera !
p438
aVIt makes me smile every time I use it .
p439
aa(lp440
VThe batteries just never dies .
p441
aVQuality of picture is more than what I have expected .
p442
aVI have had other digital cameras before but this one is the best one I have used .
p443
aVI 'm planning to buy 2 more for some friends !
p444
aa(lp445
VBoth the Kodak Zi8 and Zi6 have had early problems - like seizing up and over-heating , whiny internal mic recordings - so there are quite a few re-certified refurbished ones available - so that 's both bad and good news .
p446
aVEven when buying a Kodak re-certified\u005c/refurbished unit - one can still get a faulty one - I did - thank goodness I dealt via Amazon with Adorama - the mark of a good vendor is not just whether they deliver - but how one is treated when something is wrong - all I can say is that Adormama were more than sterling .
p447
aVWith that experience I took another chance and bought another refurbished one from Amazon\u005c/Adorama - with my previous experience I was able to thoroughly test this one , and it works just fine .
p448
aVNow to the Zi8 -LRB- being Kodak refurbished it has the latest firmware 1.06 -RRB- - the video quality is really good even compared to the already good Zi6 - I can see a marked improvement over the Zi6 's I have tried - the videos from the Zi8 look sharper and the colors looks really good - in fact I would go as far to say that the video quality looks as good as from any consumer camcorder I have seen .
p449
aVOf course $ 700 camcorders will have much more flexibility with more and real optical zoom range better image stabilization - but they cost 6-10x as much and they are not pocketable .
p450
aVMost reviews will say the digital zoom is pretty poor - I have actually found the digital zoom surprisingly good all the way up to 4x - even with nose-to-monitor scrutiny - I was really surprised at this since I do a lot of photography and the first thing one learns is not to use any digital zoom - I ca n't explain this but the digital zoom on the Zi8 is good - more than just usable -LRB- note : I record at mainly 720p\u005c/30fps -RRB- .
p451
aVThe macro ability is also really good - the depth of field is shallow - so the trick is to set macro make sure the subject is in focus BEFORE starting the recording .
p452
aVThat brings us to the LCD screen - it is high definition and sharp compared to other screens I have seen on the competition - so it is easy to see if the subject is in focus and whether the picture\u005c/scene looks good - although like any other LCD screen it will be hard to see in sunlight .
p453
aVOne of the good features of the Zi8 is the ability to connect a stereo external mic - I have a pair of really good portable stereo mic 's that I used for live music recording and the sound quality can be very good indeed - however I have found the internal mic although mono - can actually give pretty decent sound quality - there is a mic level adjustment under settings and the default middle setting seems to work really well - I recorded a big band with vocalist and the sound quality was very good .
p454
aVEIS -LRB- stabilization -RRB- does work - but obviously can not cope with gross movement .
p455
aVIt seems to work better at the normal wide-end , and less so when zoomed - but then when zoomed it is more sensitive to movement anyway .
p456
aVOn my tests I got about 1hr 38mins on a full charge of the battery and at 720p\u005c/30fps I ended up with two files one at 2Gb -LRB- for 1hr 34mins -RRB- and the other at about 86Mb - so there is a limit of 2Gb file-size -LRB- due to I think the FAT32 format of the SDHC card -RRB- and for me the rate was just over 21Mb\u005c/minute .
p457
aVNote on video resolution - obviously the big selling point of the Zi8 is the ability to record full HD at 1080p - that 's 1920x1080 - for me it 's overkill - the 720p looks as good and the view is a bit wider and it has the ability to record at 60fps which is better for motion .
p458
aVBut I 'd like to point out that there is a WVGA setting which is not just the usual 640x480 - but 848x480 - that 's really 480p wide-screen -LRB- 16:9 -RRB- format - this is actually really good for videos destined for standard DVDs - since DVD specifications are only 720x480 - so the Kodak Zi8 even on WVGA can produce videos good enough for standard DVDs .
p459
aVStills - strictly for emergencies only - the stills at the normal wide end look just acceptable - but if the digital zoom is used then the still look very poor .
p460
aVOverall I like the Zi8 a lot it 's a lot better than I expected in terms of video quality - that is if one gets a good one ... .
p461
aVHowever since the product is now more mature - hopefully this is not as uncertain as it may sound .
p462
aVPS - from what I have read -LRB- and I have read a lot -RRB- - part of the trick if one gets a faulty unit - is to return for exchange or refund with the vendor - do not use the Kodak warranty service as that can be slow - and possibly unreliable - -LRB- since I did buy a Kodak re-certified\u005c/refurbished unit previously that was faulty -RRB-

VThis is a great little camera for folks who want hi quality photos and video capability in one camera .
p465
aVI got one when they were first released and thoroughly enjoyed it until I tried the Canon 10D SLR Digital .
p466
aVNow I have two 10D cameras .
p467
aVI use the F828 as a back-up video cam or carry it in my pack when I do n't want the extra weight of the 10D .
p468
aVMy main reasons for preferring the 10D are : quicker manual adjustments , more intuitive feel , better photos , multiple lens options , great tech support .
p469
aVIf I could only have one camera , and wanted to take photos and vids , I would choose the F828 .
p470
aVOtherwise I would go with the Canon 10D or 20D and get a stand-alone video cam .

aVI owned a Noblex panoramic and found it to be a pain in the rear .
p489
aVIt was not versatile and required perfect leveling to yield results that were not obviously curved .
p490
aVThe subject matter is also of great importance and hard to obtain .
p491
aVI now use digital and software for panos and for the price of one of these cameras I can get a used computer , camera and software .
p492
aVWould be helpful to straighten out all the distortion theses cameras produce .
p493

VI had a previous version of this camera that was awesome .
p501
aVI had the camera for over 3 years and unfortunately lost it in a taxi cab on a trip about 5 months ago .
p502
aVI decided to replace it with the latest and greatest Olympus version .
p503
aVI had praised my previous camera to everyone I knew .
p504
aVHowever , here are the things that I have found about this latest 8010 version .
p505
aV1 .
p506
aVFirst , a large percentage of the time , this camera will NOT focus .
p507
aVYou will point this camera at everything in the frame and continue to get the sad sound of no focus .
p508
aVThis is a very irritating point .
p509
aV2 .
p510
aVSecond you will have to wait approximately 1 to 2 seconds after you push the shutter release before it will take a picture .
p511
aVIf you are trying to `` catch '' a memory on film , then forget it .
p512
aV3 .
p513
aVThe battery life is atrocious and you ca n't replace the battery or buy an extra .
p514
aVYou charge the camera by plugging the whole camera in the wall .
p515
aVHowever , I think I found the reason that the battery has no usable life span .
p516
aVWith the camera on auto , the flash , flashes , on every photo regardless of how much light you have available .
p517
aVTest this by pointing the camera at a light fixture and take a picture or take it outside on a sunny day and take a picture and you will see that the flash fires .
p518
aVIt tries to use the lowest shutter speed possible but even with a shutter speed of 125 or 250 , the flash still fires .
p519
aVI personally believe that this is the primary reason for the lack of battery life .
p520
aV4 .
p521
aVThe image quality is not commiserate of a 14mp camera .
p522
aVMany of my photos are washed out and not even usable whereas my older version had people gasping at how amazing they were !
p523
aVI sent the camera off to have it `` repaired '' with my full list of complaints only to have it returned with no documentation on what they found or what they fixed .
p524
aVI took it out of the box and immediately found that the flash still fires on every photo .
p525
aVGo figure .
p526
aVI bought this from Best buy and even though I have the reciept , I do n't believe that I have any recourse .
p527
aVIf I did , I 'd return it and exchange it for a different camera all together .
p528
aVI believe that these are the toughest cameras out there , but if they do n't perform and bring home the pictures , then they are not worth the money .
p529
aVI hope this review helps .
p530
aa(lp531
VI bought this camera just last week and have not put it down since .
p532
aVI spent some time deciding between the rebel xt and the kd100 .
p533
aVIn the end I went with the rebel simply because of the 8 megapixels and overall better reviews .
p534
aVIn fact the only reason I considered the kd100 was because everyone said the rebel was too light , felt flimsy , or was too small to hold .
p535
aVNaturally when the rebel arrived in the mail I immiedately examined the build quality and size of the camera .
p536
aVTo be honest i would n't want a camera any larger , and I had no problem with the hard plastic body which I thought felt very sturdy in my hands .
p537
aVSize issues aside , this camera delivers fantastic pictures at an affordable price and that 's exactly what I wanted .
p538
aa(lp539
VThis camera is as close to digital as you can get without the price , it has many features and is simple to use , a great buy
p540
aa(lp541
VI just upgraded my digital camera from an older Canon Powershot G2 to this new S3 .
p542
aVI recently attended a reception and all I can say is Wow !
p543
aVI loved my older camera but dark scenes posed a particulary nasty problem .
p544
aVWith this camera I was able to capture people across the room with only the flash on the camera .
p545
aVSo far , this camera rocks .
p546
aVI 'll be taking it on a long trip in August to test out all the options .
p547
aVOnly thing I miss is the remote control .
p548
aVA nice thing about the camera is the viewfinder .
p549
aVIt fits very comfortably on the eye and I 'll never take a lens cap picture again , since like the digital slrs , what you see in the viewfinder is what the ccd actually sees .

VI 've used Polaroid cameras off and on since the Swinger came out in the 60 's .
p552
aVI 've had the SX-70 and the One Step .
p553
aVThe Polaroid One is by far the easiest to use .
p554
aVThe LCD film counter on the back is easy to read and the pictures are clear .
p555
aVThe camera takes type 660 film or even takes type 779 professional film for better colors and better clarity .
p556
aVThe camera is solidly built , fits into your hand comfortably and is easy to carry thanks to a two position hand strap .
p557
aVPolaroids have always been fun cameras .
p558
aVThis one is no exception .
p559
aa(lp560
Vbought 4 of these and they seem to be solid little unites .
p561
aVthe documentation could be a lot better and net work integration much easier .
p562
aVnot for people with little net work knowledge .
p563
aVall in all if your willing to put some effort into the tech side of installation then not a bad buy .
p564
aa(lp565
VJust had my first child and bought this as a quick point and shoot in all conditions .
p566
aVSimply said , this camera is AWESOME .
p567
aVI have not missed a single magic moment and absolutely love the quality of the images in all lighting conditions .
p568
aVIt 's also so durable that I hang it from a lanyard around my neck , no need for a camera case that gets in the way when you need to point and shoot quickly

VI purchased this item more than 6 months back from Amazon .
p599
aVIt is a wonderful entry level SLR .
p600
aVEven if you use it as a point and shoot -LRB- in the Auto mode -RRB- you get much better pictures than a non-SLR camera .
p601
aVAnd of course , it really helps if you want to start using all the features and functionalities of an SLR .
p602
aVI have nothing to say that has n't been said here , but am leaving a review and a well deserved 5 star for the item .
p603
aVIt is a classic .
p604
aVJust check Ken Rockwell 's guide to hear what he has to say about the D40 .
p605
aa(lp606
VI received this camera for Christmas and have already taken close to 300 photos on the supplied batteries .
p607
aVBy the way , Amazon had the lowest price of all the on-line places I looked and they even shipped it free !
p608
aVThus far , I 'm very impressed with the color accuracy in this camera .
p609
aVThe feature I needed most was fast shutter speed -LRB- fidgety grandkids -RRB- and it delivers nicely .
p610
aVHowever , the feature that surprised me most was the anti-shake which is excellent when in the telephoto mode .
p611
aVI was able to take photos of cars in front of us while traveling as a passenger at 75 mph on the interstate in full telephoto mode and could read license plates very clearly in the photos !
p612
aVI highly recommend buying the lens adapter ring which is very inexpensive and which allows you to add filters , telephoto and wide angle lenses to this camera to make it even more versatile .
p613
aVI find the controls to be intuitive and user friendly and in the auto mode , my wife can take great pictures .
p614
aa(lp615
VThis is my 3rd flipcam and i like them a lot .
p616
aVI just wish they still had a future and were steaming right along .
p617
aVSadly Cisco is discontinuing the software .
p618
aVOh well .
p619
aVI figured I would buy one last flip since they are so easy to use and it is so easy to create movies on flipshare .
p620
aVThat 's what I 'll miss -- the ease of movie creation .
p621
aVWhy do all the good products always get discontinued ?
p622
aVI know of no other movie making software as easy and thorough as flipshare .
p623
aVDoes anyone else ?
p624
aVWhat else have you found comparable ?
p625
aVI 'd be curious to know for the future .
p626
aVAnyway , flipshare will be around until Dec 2013 and I for one plan on using it quite often as I have been for yrs now .
p627
aVI rate this product highly as I always have .
p628
aVIt 's so much fun and so easy to document whatever you want to on video .
p629
aVStill wondering what I will go to after the flip era ends ... ... ... : -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- I know I 'll find something .
p630
aa(lp631
VJust received this camera in the mail last week as an upgrade to my XSi .
p632
aVIf you are contemplating the same move , i will tell you it 's definitely worth it for the improved ISO performance alone .
p633
aVI took a few indoor shots without a flash at ISO 800 .
p634
aVCompared to my XSi , the 60D blew it away .
p635
aVI am also very happy with the higher burst rate .
p636
aVDefinitely worth having with kids in the house .
p637
aVVideo : using the kit lens -LRB- 18-135mm -RRB- I 'd suggest only filming in a well lit area until you get a better lens .
p638
aVI needed to set my ISO over 2,000 to achieve visibility on the screen .
p639
aVI took my Panasonic SD60 camcorder and had no problem shooting good video with low\u005c/no grain in the same room\u005c/lighting .
p640
aVHowever , shooting video in a well lit room produced great results but at times it was difficult to tell if i had the subject in focus on the swivel screen .
p641
aVSome of the ergonomics that people have issues with are true but not enough to deter me from buying this camera .
p642
aVThe reviewer below me -LRB- by date -RRB- named them all : 1 -RRB- on\u005c/off switch : very small tab to flip over .
p643
aV2 -RRB- That left dial : wish it would rotate continuously instead of having a stop point .
p644
aVI do n't switch modes too often so it 's not a huge issue but if you do like to switch modes , i can see it as a future frustration .
p645
aV3 -RRB- When having the screen flipped out , you realize the delete photo\u005c/video button is in a bad position .
p646
aVThe fix : do n't have the screen flipped out or delete the photos at a later time .
p647
aVI prefer to delete the bad photos\u005c/videos immediately after shooting so it 's an irritant .
p648
aVOverall , I would recommend this camera as an upgrade over the older Rebel series and as a first time user of DSLR 's .
p649
aVOTOH , it would be difficult to recommend this over the T3i unless you need the higher burst speed I will report back in a few months after some more extensive usage .
p650
aVI 've only taken about a dozen videos and a hundred photos so far .
p651
aa(lp652
VIn reading reviews about cannon S2 and S3 I could n't decide on one .
p653
aVSo I bought both to campare them .
p654
aVI printed out pics and family voted .
p655
aVThe S3 were much clearer .
p656
aVI tired the S2 first and did n't think it could get easier .
p657
aVI was wrong .
p658
aVThe S3 is so easy .
p659
aVI know nothing about photography and in no time I was taking beautiful pictures that others say look professional .
p660
aVI love the macro mode to get closeups and the S3 has the iso button on the front so you can change it when you want .
p661
aVno having to go through menu looking for it .
p662
aVIn reviews I read that this camera might be too much for a beginner .
p663
aVThat could n't be more wrong .
p664
aVSo the S2 went back .
p665
aVNot that it 's a bad camera at all but I thought the $ 40.00 more was worth the better picture quality I got .
p666
aa(lp667
Vreally great product .
p668
aVthis was a gift fro my daughther and she and i have ejoy since the first day href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YOVF90/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/185-9137819-8376344"> Fujifilm INSTAX 210 Instant Photo Camera Kit with 5 Twin Pack of INSTAX Film 
p669
aa(lp670
VThis is a great choice for moving up from a compact camera .
p671
aVThe difference in picture quality is stunning .
p672
aVI 've had no problems with it and it was not difficult to learn how to use the menus , etc. .
p673
aa(lp674
VBought this camera especially for our honeymoon cruise to the Caribbean and it performed admirably .
p675
aVIts ease of use made it a pleasure throughout the trip .
p676
aVI would advise reading the entire owner 's manual and practicing using the various settings .
p677
aVOnce I did that , I was able to switch settings rather quickly and capture great shots .
p678
aVOne of the best features of the camera is the wide-angle lens .
p679
aVThis is particularly effective when taking shots of scenery ... beaches , island mountain ranges , etc. .
p680
aVI took photos while on horseback , in low light , in bright light and all the photos looked great .
p681
aVThe image stabilizer resulted in sharp , clear photos even when I was not able to hold the camera steady .
p682
aVI would advise getting an extra battery since there 's no low battery indicator on the camera .
p683
aVAlso , a case is essential .
p684
aa(lp685
VIn the interest of full disclosure , my other camera is a Canon 5D with six `` L '' lenses , probably worth about $ 10,000 .
p686
aVSo it might not be a fair comparison to write a review for a $ 70 camera .
p687
aVBut this thing truly IS garbage .
p688
aVI am yet to see 3 photos in a row that are sharp .
p689
aVNoise is unbearable .
p690
aVFocus is a joke .
p691
aVThe `` 12 megapixels '' is also a joke .
p692
aVI 'm seriously considering returning this garbage .
p693
aVIt 's by far the worst camera I 've ever seen .
p694
aVNice to have a tiny little camera for when I do n't want to take the 5D out , but what 's the point when 80 % of your shots will be unusable ?
p695
aa(lp696
VGreat camera .
p697
aVVery small -LRB- fits in a pocket -RRB- and very easy to use .
p698
aVMost pictures come out great .
p699
aVThere are some issues with over exposure at times , but in general I love this camera .
p700
aVOne other very minor quirk is that due to the shape  size , it 's very easy for your finger to make its way into the picture .
p701
aVHave to get use to holding it from the edges .
p702
aVI 'd recommend this camera to others .
p703
aa(lp704
VI gave up a Canon Coolpix 5700 for this little camera and I love it .
p705
aVAs much as I loved my Coolpix , it was just too outdated for my use and I just could n't afford a new one .
p706
aVThis little camera does everything that one did and more !
p707
aVEasy to use and very compact .
p708
aVJust throw it in your purse or bag and go !!

VI have bought Canon Cameras since my T-50 back in the early 80 's .
p711
aV-LRB- which I still have -RRB- I was totally excited about the T2i after reading the other comments .
p712
aVI have ordered from Amazon in the past and have always been impressed with their service .
p713
aVIt was still a bit of a surprise when my package came just 1 day after placing my order .
p714
aVWOW !
p715
aVI took the camera to my son 's wrestling tournament and in no time was shooting great pics .
p716
aVI have been taking sports pics for a while now and the pics being excellent was an expectation that was well met .
p717
aVThe camera adjusted easily for indoor , not so bright gym , sports action pics .
p718
aVIt felt really great when my friends asked which Canon that I was shooting with and I could say `` The T2i '' .
p719
aVMy last one is the Xsi , while an awesome piece , does not compare to the T2i .
p720
aVThe VIDEO really grabbed me !
p721
aVThe quality was like Blue Ray DVD .
p722
aVIt used up a lot of memory but WOW !
p723
aVIt was out of this world .
p724
aVIf you can afford this Camera ... BUY IT !
p725
aVIf you ca n't afford it ... Finance it !
p726

p727

V... and it 's still going strong .
p730
aVMy wife used to purchase the Kodak\u005c/Fuji single use underwater film cameras whenever we 'd go on a trip which included opportunities for underwater pictures .
p731
aVThen , afterwards the pain of taking it in to be developed , and ending out with only a couple pictures worth keeping .
p732
aVThe other problem you have with the single use cameras is that you do n't have incentive to be taking lots of pictures - you 're constrained buy how many cameras you 've brought along , and then knowing you 're going to have to pay to develop anything you shoot .
p733
aVAt the time I purchased , I figured this reasonably priced underwater digital camera had to be a better way to go .
p734
aVSure enough , this camera has exceeded all my expectations .
p735
aVOn that first cruise I purchased it for , the underwater photos were very good .
p736
aVI did n't take much video , but it was acceptable .
p737
aVMy main purpose was for an underwater camera - the video is just a bonus for me , if I 'd even use it .
p738
aVPersonally , I was never a photo person .
p739
aVMy wife has her Nikon Dxxx , spends a small fortune on it , and is always lugging it around somewhere with her equipment .
p740
aVThis camera is just fabulous for me - stick in in my pocket and whenever we 're on vacation or a trip , it is effortless to get quick shots .
p741
aVIt powers up very quickly , and with a good Class 10 memory card I can snap picture after picture without worry .
p742
aVMy daughter even gets annoyed at me that I snap so many pictures of her .
p743
aVWhat the heck - it does n't cost anything to develop , and the more I take , the better the chance of catching that great shot .
p744
aVThe 5MP capability is good enough for me - again , not the professional photographer here - just want to get good shots , no need for SLR quality .
p745
aVBut , back to the water\u005c/underwater capability - all of the openings have rubber gromets around them creating a good watertight seal .
p746
aVI have used it in very salty water as well as chlorine .
p747
aVOnce done for the day , just soak\u005c/wash it in clean water , dry it and it 's good to go .
p748
aVAlso , the package includes every cable you need - nothing extra to buy .
p749
aVWe 'd be out for the day , snapping pictures and video , get back to the cruise ship and connect the camera up to the TV - no problem .
p750
aVUploading to your computer or other device is simple - just plug in the USB cable and it 's all available .
p751
aVAlso , the ArcSoft photo software is resident in the camera , so when you first connect the USB , it will want to install .
p752
aVIt also automatically launches the software if it 's already installed and you connect the camera .
p753
aVThis can be a little annoying if you do n't want to use their software - because you have to cancel it everytime you connect the camera .
p754
aVMinor inconvenience .
p755
aVIn any case , to summarize , this is a very good underwater alternative .
p756
aVIt does a good job with underwater pictures and video , and also as a general purpose point and shoot camera .
p757
aVFor the average user , coupled with a good memory card , it 's a quality product and you 'll be very happy with the pictures .
p758
aa(lp759
VEvery thing is fine , for a point and shoot cam .
p760
aVPhoto quality is excellent .
p761
aVGood light sensitivity -LRB- can take indoor pics with confident -RRB- .
p762
aVThe only thing that cause little annoyance is the responsiveness .
p763
aVYou have to wait 2-3s , after your click , for the picture to save in memory card .

VThe Canon S90 is so handy that my WIFE loves it -- With image quality so good that a SERIOUS photographer loves it too .
p766
aVThe Canon S90 `` just works . ''
p767
aVIt 's so small , light , and easy to use , that I always have it with me and always get great image quality .
p768
aV-LRB- You do n't get great pictures if the camera 's too bothersome to bring along . -RRB-
p769
aVPanasonic 's LX3 is the one other compact that matches S90 image quality -- But the LX3 's a little too big for my pockets and its low light images are noisier .
p770
aVWhat the LX3 DOES offer are much wider angle images -LRB- 24mm -- 18mm with adapter lens , vs. the S90 's 28mm -RRB- .
p771
aVFor wide and ultra-wide angle shooting , I use the LX3 -- For everything else -LRB- convenience , and low light -RRB- I use the S90 .
p772
aVBoth cameras are excellent .
p773
aVThe S90 -LRB- and LX3 -RRB- are the ONLY compacts with image quality good enough to blend into my Nikon D700 `` slide shows . ''
p774
aVFinally , a HUGE plus , the S90 -LRB- and LX3 -RRB- shoot in RAW , not just JPEG .
p775
aVTheir RAW format lets me do AMAZING things with their images in digital editors like Adobe Camera Raw\u005c/Photoshop , Nikon Capture NX2 , and DxO Optics Pro .
p776
aa(lp777
VI 've owned the Lumix LX-5 for about a month now and have carried it with me nearly every day and captured over 550 images in that time .
p778
aVI 've been using it to shoot mainly street photography at 28\u005c/35mm in manual focus , ISO 400 , aperture priority and typically shooting from the hip .
p779
aVThe depth of field indicator when in manual focus mode is invaluable for this style of shooting and I 've been very impressed with the quality of the images the camera produces when used this way .
p780
aVI 've also used it occasionally for more standard compact camera duty : family and friends candids during a birthday party , family portraiture , etc. .
p781
aVSpeed from shot to shot left a little to be desired in some of these cases , but I shoot RAW and am not using a particularly fast memory card which may be contributing to the lag I 've experienced .
p782
aVMy general impression after 30 days of shooting is that this is one of the best compact cameras with this feature set .
p783
aVI expect to continue to carry it with me and shoot every day .
p784
aVKey complaints that keep me from rating it at 5 stars are : \u005c* grip ergonomics are poor if you have large hands \u005c* LCD display performs poorly in bright environments \u005c* imaging performance at speeds over ISO400

VAs an `` Old School '' 35mm film camera user -- I cut my teeth on a Canon AE1 -- this camera was a great choice for my first , entry-level digital camera .
p787
aVI received it just days before a trip to Disney World .
p788
aVManaged to take hundreds of pictures and all of them are great .
p789
aVOne reason I purchased this camera was because it has an viewfinder like my AE1 .
p790
aVI ca n't stand watching people hold their camera 12 inches away from there face and I wo n't do that .
p791
aVThis camera is fairly easy to use .
p792
aVI just wish the zoom was manual cause I think I could zoom more the way I can it quicker and better without depending on the mechanics of the camera .
p793
aa(lp794
VI bought this for my father-in-law .
p795
aVHe loved it , but the camera froze up after about 5 months .
p796
aVIt had to be returned .
p797
aVIt was still under the one year warranty .
p798
aVThe replacement works fine .
p799
aVIf you like a larger display screen , this is not it .
p800
aVCheck out the T-100 or newer T-200 .
p801
aa(lp802
VPerforms well with just about everything I 've thrown at it !
p803
aVTakes amazing indoor pictures even in low-light situations -LRB- without using a flash -RRB- .
p804
aVI was torn between this camera and the Nikon One , but I 'm VERY happy with my decision to go with Panasonic instead .
p805
aVFor the price of the Nikon 1 as well as the investment you would need in extra lenses , the Panasonic is the best bang for your buck .
p806
aVPros : - Fairly easy to navigate controls right out of the box - Performs well in low-light even without the flash - Amazing focus - Ability to add extra lenses or filters if desired - Swivel display screen is great for those tricky shots or group portraits - Option to use a different flash with built-in hot shoe - Creative Control settings as well as pick up and go standard settings - Zoom works great , and you do n't have to lug around large -LRB-  expensive -RRB- extra lenses Cons : - Indoor video records a little too dark , even with several light sources

VI 've owned this camera for about two months now and I believe I 've found the holy grail as far as the best quality picture producing camera in it 's price range .
p809
aVHD is one of the best inventions that advanced technology has produced in the past ten years and the Panasonic AG-HMC40 is one of the best HD prosumer cameras on the market today .
p810
aVFor twenty years I have been buying and using various brands of camcorders and have always stuck with Sony , but I have lately been impressed with some of the new AVCHD cameras from Panasonic .
p811
aVI already own three other CMOS camcorders and have been impressed with the CMOS technology .
p812
aVI would not hesitate a bit to recommend the AG-HMC40 to anyone looking for the best prosumer HD camera in this price range .
p813
aVIf I had to pick a word that best describes it : `` spectacular ! ''
p814
aa(lp815
VBattery last forever .
p816
aVGreat pictures for my screen savers and family .
p817
aVI love this camera and am so glad for purchasing it .

VA good solid camera !
p821
aVI have the maxxum 7 film camera that the 7d is based on so the transition was very easy .
p822
aVI like the controls being out in the open instead of settings being buried in menus .
p823
aVIt may look like you have to have an engineering degree when you count the buttons and dials -LRB- around 25 , depending on what you include -RRB- , but the controls are easy to learn as everything is clearly and logically marked .
p824
aVThe anti-shake has been impressive .
p825
aVI have gotten acceptable sharpness from shots taken with a 300mm f4 wide open at 1\u005c/30th .
p826
aVAny panning or dragging the shutter seems to have better results with the AS turned off .
p827
aVWith a fast memory card -LRB- sandisk extreme III -RRB- I get around 20 shots continuous before the camera slows to write to the card with a full buffer .
p828
aVA good camera that is even better now that the price has come down .

VYou may want to consider another brand of point and shoot 35mm film camera .
p831
aVWe purchased this camera a little over a year ago , suddenly last week it would no longer load film .
p832
aVBeing just beyond the 1 year warranty , we contacted Canon Service for information on repair .
p833
aVWe were instructed to send the camera to them for evaluation .
p834
aVWe received a phone call from them indicating the camera could not be repaired as they did n't have the parts .
p835
aVThey could n't even offer a replacement of the same camera .
p836
aVWhat they did offer was the 150U model for $ 88 with only a 6 month warranty .
p837
aVBased on the reviews here , it sounds like the 150 is not altogether great either .
p838
aVUp until the time the camera quit functioning it took good photos and was easy to use .
p839
aVI just think for $ 100 a camera should last more than 15 months and be serviceable .
p840
aVThis just seems too much like planned obsolescence to me .
p841
aa(lp842
VI bought this film camera to use with my Canon digital XTi .
p843
aVI like to shoot both film and digital , and these two cameras use the same lenses , which is a plus .
p844
aVI do a lot of photo documentation , and with a negative in hand , there is less chance to claim that something has been ` photoshopped ' .
p845
aVThis is important in my line of research .
p846
aVThe camera itself is a delight to use , and is light weight .
p847
aVThe AF is flawless and very fast .
p848
aVThe viewfinder is bright , and the mirror and shutter are relativly quiet , another important quality in my line of work .
p849
aVThe grip provides a secure feel , again , which is important in the field .
p850
aVI would recomend the camera body without hesitation .
p851
aVThe lens on the other hand is OK , but not great .
p852
aVI do not like lenses without a metal mounting bayonet , so I ditched the kit lens , and replaced it with the better lenses made by Canon .
p853
aVI want a tight , vibration free mount , and I do not trust plastic lens mounts .
p854
aVIn all , this was a great bargan , and have already shot several rolls of film with it .
p855
aa(lp856
VI bought a new Levana TW-301 which I had a problem with the first night .
p857
aVThe night light vision would n't work .
p858
aVI contacted Levana about it on their website e-mail and they sent me a return authorization and said they would send a replacement monitor if it was found to have a been defective by a technician .
p859
aVI returned it with the original wrapping with the purchase receipt and they sent me back the same monitor loose with bubble wrap in a cardboard box .
p860
aVNeedless to say I was angry they did n't send a new product and when I contacted them again asking why , they said that the original product had been discontinued so they could n't send me a new one .
p861
aVSo why could n't they send me a new comparable one instead ?
p862
aVYou ca n't talk to them by phone which makes me even more angry .
p863
aa(lp864
VI liked almost everything about the camera except the auto focus .
p865
aVIt would go in and out of focus at will .
p866
aVSometimes it was clear and then for no reason it would be blurred for awhile .
p867
aVAlso the the microphone was really susceptable to wind or any kind of movement making it really annoying to listen to .
p868
aVIt is not a low light camera at all as most of Kodak camera 's are not low light camera 's .
p869
aVI returned it because I could n't get the clear pictures I wanted .
p870
aa(lp871
VUsed this camera in a snorkeling escapade where the sun was really , really bright .
p872
aVThe photos were taken approximately from depths ranging from above water-3 feet deep .
p873
aVAll of the photos lack really good sharpness , clarity and are somewhat fuzzy .
p874
aVIf you can remember the 35mm camera taking days you will understand exactly what to expect .
p875
aVThese photos represent that cheaper rolls of 200 speed film that one could buy for their 35mm cameras back then .
p876
aVIf you recall the absence of crispness , detail and such ... then you know exactly what i am talking about .
p877
aVFor that is how all of my photos turned out .
p878
aVSlightly below average photos .
p879
aVIf you were going to take a bunch of photos i would suggest buying a cheaper , compact digital camera and one of the waterproof pouches that allow for taking of pictures underwater .
p880
aVA digital camera that does not have the telescopic lens would be ideal in these type bags .
p881
aVBy the time you purchase 3 of these cameras and have the pictures developed at $ 10.00 per , you have already spent enough money to purchase a small compact digital camera .

p886
aVWhy the Canon ?
p887
aVLeast digital noise in higher ISO settings , durable body , very user-friendly settings .
p888
aVThis XTi has a quick change on point of focus and a larger LCD viewer which I like .
p889
aVIn the nearly 3 yrs of using my first Rebel , I have n't found much about these cameras I do n't like .
p890
aVThe one thing I miss , that I had with my G series Canon point  shoot , is a preview of my shots in a tip-out LCD viewer .

aVThat being said - it 's a great camera for the money .

VThis is my first mega-zoom point and shoot .
p895
aVI went from a little 5 mega-pixel Kodak that in a bundle cost around $ 100 around 8 yrs ago to this Canon .
p896
aVI could not be happier .
p897
aVI have not tried out the video yet and most likely wo n't as I do not use it -LRB- only once with the other camera -RRB- .
p898
aVThe easy of use of the camera and the pictures you get are unbelievable .
p899
aVI did my research before ordering and was going between this one and the Coolpix 120 .
p900
aVCost made me go with this one .
p901
aVI had already read that when you get your camera the first thing you do before putting batteries in is read the manual then practice with camera .
p902
aVTrust me , this makes all the difference .
p903
aVAnd we are not talking about reading the little Getting Started booklet that is in the box , talking about install software and reading the full length manual .
p904
aVThankfully everything is easy to remember and the camera will help you out .
p905
aVI love it .

VMy main camera is a Nikon D7000 SLR but it is a lot to take on frequent motorcycle trips so I got the Leica with the expectation that I would have to sacrifice some quality .
p908
aVI was surprised at the crisp well balanced and saturated pictures that the Leica produced .
p909
aVIt is seriously better than my 14 megapixel Sony cybershot .
p910
aVAfter trying various settings I settled on fully automatic .
p911
aVThat is unusual for me because I am a control freak but the camera produces the best shots on it 's own .
p912
aVThe zoom range from medium wide , useful indoors , to the longest optical is very useful and the superb lens is almost just sharp far out as medium .
p913
aVThat is a 35 mm equivalent of 25 to 300 mm , just as good as my big Nikon .
p914
aVUnfortunately the camera is made in Japan by Panasonic and does not have the build quality of most Leicas .
p915
aVIt is still good but the flimsy battery door cover and lock switch , the on off switch and controls in general are nothing like an M3 although good by point and shoot comparisons .
p916
aVThis is a premium priced point and shoot and I expected better .
p917
aV-LRB- The price is nothing like an M3 either . -RRB-
p918
aVBattery life is adequate at a claimed 300 shots -LRB- 200 realistically -RRB- so I bought a spare - not cheap .
p919
aVI travel without a charger .
p920
aVThe charger is very small and very fast .
p921
aVDespite the relatively delicate construction I am delighted with the results and virtual lack of shutter lag , an annoying feature of most compact cameras .
p922
aVEven the flash seems instant on .
p923
aVI am hard on cameras and if the build quality was higher and the battery life longer it would get a 5 star rating .
p924
aVOne last point , the leather case is stupidly expensive and does n't help Leica 's value for money image .
p925
aVThe $ 169 price has spawned countless asian knockoffs so if you do buy one be careful .
p926
aVYou wo n't get a real one for $ 30.00
p927
aa(lp928
VThis item is more of a fashion gadget than a professional Leica .
p929
aVThe pictures are n't so bad , just keep in mind it is a 5 megapixel camera .
p930
aVBut perfect for facebook pics !
p931
aVAnd its so small that you can take it everywhere !
p932
aa(lp933
VThis camera is at best a basic unit .
p934
aVIt has all that is necessary for the enthusiast that wants to test their true artistic ability .
p935
aVFor those that are thinking that the camera is what makes a picture then perhaps they are better buying something that does everything for them like auto focus , speed and aperture .
p936
aVThis camera is completely manual .
p937
aVIt requires thought in the composition of the subject , setting speed and aperture to suit the desired result .
p938
aVIn the end it is the eyes capacity to take in the factors that make a picture and compensate for them using the cameras features as a tool .
p939
aVThe art of photography is not how smart the camera is but more how thoughtful the photographer is in preparing to take the shot .
p940
aVI bought this camera because I had become too complacent with auto everything and found that the quality of my pictures had degraded from when I took photos with a fully manual camera .
p941
aVSure there is the option with many automatic cameras to set it to manual but then one is inclined to forget this option and take the easy way out .
p942
aVSome aspects of the camera appear crude in its construction .
p943
aVIt is a little small for my hands , but I am content with it all the same .
p944
aVThe weight is slightly unbalanced , feeling heavy and the shutter feels like it is too physical in that if I were to take a photo in poor light the shutter action might jar the camera and cause unwanted blurring .
p945
aVI have not yet found this to be the case but then I have not put it to the test either .
p946
aVFor the price it is adequate and will function even if the batteries go flat .
p947
aVThis is its biggest appeal to me as I 'm sure that with four days of hiking in the mountains my digital camera 's battery will undoubtedly be flat by the end .
p948
aVThere is something romantic about film .
p949
aVYou do n't get the instant gratification that the digital provides but then you become more focused on making sure the shot is right .
p950
aVWhile I read that film will never die I am finding that acquiring high resolution ISO is becoming harder to purchase .
p951
aVThis is a bit disconcerting .
p952
aVIt does seem that most film vendors favor poor resolution film to guarantee the purchaser that all shots will produce something due to the capacity for the 200\u005c/400 ISO films coping with poor lighting conditions .
p953
aVThe sacrifice is the grainy low resolution images it produces .
p954
aVThat 's fine if you want arty photo 's using grain as a special affect .
p955
aVI want 100 ISO B for its fine grain and yet in my town it seems it has long gone .
p956
aVThe camera however is a good robust apparatus and great for traveling in rough terrain due to its rugged steel body construction .
p957
aa(lp958
VMy 60d came with problems in lots of pixels .
p959
aVThe defects are some strange patterns that look like an `` X '' , they appear in 4 positions of the pictures , always in the same positions .
p960
aVIt is happening only in night shots taken : 1 - Low ISO -LRB- 100 -RRB- with long exposure time 1 second or more .
p961
aV2 - High ISO -LRB- 3200 or more -RRB- with small exposure time .
p962
aVI 've opened a ticket in Canon Site , I do n't liked the answers , I was waiting that they replace the defective camera , instead , they answered it is OK inside the statistics .
p963
aVTake a look at the response : `` Hot pixels '' are usually visible at long shutter speeds and\u005c/or high ISO settings .
p964
aVThe camera 's sensor is made up of millions of pixels , thus it is nearly impossible to guarantee all the photosites have an equal sensitivity to light .
p965
aVThus when exposed at different shutter speeds , some will be more sensitive than others and will show up as a ` hot pixel ' .
p966
aVBecause the camera uses a CMOS sensor as opposed to a CCD design , hot pixels are greatly reduced in comparison .
p967
aVSimply replacing the camera body may yield a unit with more or less `` hot pixels '' areas .
p968
aVThe simple fact is `` hot pixels '' is a fact of digital imaging .
p969
aVYour 60D camera is equipped with `` Long exposure noise reduction '' -LRB- C. Fn II-1 -RRB- .
p970
aVThis custom function can be turned on -LRB- refer to page 254 in your manual -RRB- .
p971
aVYou may also consider `` High ISO speed noise reduction -LRB- C. Fn II-2 -RRB- -LRB- noise in lower ISO speeds are in shadow areas are further reduced -RRB- -LRB- refer to page 254 in your manual -RRB- .
p972
aVAlternately , there are several known techniques that may be employed to reduce and in some cases totally remove hot pixels altogether i.e re-sampling , black frame .
p973
aVSeveral third - party applications\u005c/utilities are available that feature a `` hot pixel '' removal function .
p974
aVYour sample image has been reviewed by service and they have confirmed that your camera is within tolerance .
p975
aVAs mentioned previously , it is not uncommon see hot pixels -LRB- or in this case a small cluster pixels - depending on photo editor , it may render the cluster to look like an `` X '' -RRB- at long shutter speeds .
p976
aVAs such , you may consider the steps mentioned previously or photo editing software to remove the pixels .
p977
aa(lp978
VThe camera worked perfectly for one week and then stopped working permanently .
p979
aVI just sent it off for repairs and have not received a diagnosis as to the root of the problem .
p980
aa(lp981
VThe color and the image quality is awesome .
p982
aVIt is a very durable and light camera .
p983
aVAnd since it uses AAA batteries , you do n't have to worry about not having enough power .
p984
aVThe camera is very thin and nice-looking .
p985
aa(lp986
VThe FujiFilm Z90 is a solid point and shoot camera that fits nicely in the middle range of the camera market .
p987
aVAs another reviewer pointed out , the 14 MP resolution is what seems to set it apart , but unless you are printing poster sized pictures you are n't ever going to realize any benefit from the higher mega-pixels .
p988
aVSo if you are looking at that attribute and thinking you are getting a bargain on a high end camera , you are n't .
p989
aVHowever , this is a solid , flexible device that definitely fits a need .
p990
aVFeaturing the aforementioned 14 megapixels , a solid 5x optical zoom and the ability to shoot 720P HD video , the Z90 can do a lot of different things reasonably well , and does so in a robust , attractive package .
p991
aVIn particular , the lens is completely covered when the camera is off , making it ideal for carrying in a pocket or purse , or stashing in the glove compartment for unexpected photo opportunities .
p992
aVObviously everyone will use this camera differently , but for me it fits perfectly in the niche where I do n't want to carry my larger , heavier Sony CyberShot , but want something more robust than my cell phone camera , i.e. concerts , kids sporting events , etc. .
p993
aVIt 's not necessarily the kind of camera you want to rely on to record the first hours of your child 's life or a wedding , but for everyday use it more than fits the bill .
p994
aVIn fact , the ideal consumer of this camera , to my mind , is a high-schooler or recent graduate .
p995
aVAs people who likely wo n't have\u005c/can ' t afford a high end smartphone or more expensive SLR camera , the Z90 is the perfect fit .
p996
aVIt 's robust , feature rich , portable and reasonably priced which makes it perfect for someone in the 15-25 demographic .
p997
aVLikewise , if you already have a more expensive , but bigger , SLR camera but are looking for something more portable and less fragile to keep around for unexpected moments , this is also an excellent option .
p998
aVFinally , I should mention that while the technical description indicates the phone does not come with a memory card , mine came with a 4 GB card in the box .
p999
aVI do n't know if this is because there is an error in the description or because I received the camera through the Vine Program , but hold off on buying a card until the camera arrives , just in case .
p1000
aa(lp1001
VWe bought the camera and camera dock .
p1002
aVBasically , the camera is easy to use .
p1003
aVWe are not tech people but we were able to shoot pictures and move them to our computer easily , the first day , with minimal referral to the instruction book .
p1004
aVThe camera and computer software were easy to use .
p1005
aa(lp1006
VThe description was accurate , everything works great -LRB- including the flash -RRB- , and was included in the package .

aVThe 450 is just nicer - quiter , larger screen and the price went down right after I received the 400 .

p1022
aVThe camera is slim , light and easy to use .
p1023
aVI bought it for portability , look and features , especially HDMI connectivity .
p1024

VI wanted a DSLR for all of the traveling I do and this camera has turned out great .

VRecently , my old TR81 -LRB- first Hi8 -RRB- from Sony broke - the AF did not work any more .
p1029
aVOf course the new Sony Hi8 338 is light years ahead of my almost 15 years old camcorder .
p1030
aVThe Hi8 standard still produces very good picture quality for the price .
p1031
aVThe new HD quality camcorders are $ 2000 + .
p1032
aVFor me I will stick with the Hi8 until the HD prices come down and when I get a HD TV as well .
p1033
aVThis is a great value camcorder for taking family moments .
p1034

VI loved the camera .

p1037
aVgreat quality , solid build .

p1039
aVbut I returned it for the UltraHD .
p1040
aVThe 8GB Ultra is only a little more and you get twice the storage , removable batteries , and the FlipPort for future peripherals .
p1041

VGreat camera for college photography class .
p1043
aVCan be expanded for other uses after taking your class .

VWhen I first received my S9000 I was completely in love with it .
p1047
aVIt had all the features I was looking for in one package for my travel needs .
p1048
aVOnly weeks after I had been using the camera the selector dial quit working making it unable to access certain menus and features reducing it to a fancy point and shoot camera .
p1049
aVThen I enlarged some of my photos and realize about 1\u005c/5th of the left side of each photo was blurred .
p1050
aVThe rest of the photo was in focus .
p1051
aVI went into my archive and realized this was the case with each photo I had taken when I pulled them up to 100 % .
p1052
aVI then inspected my zoom photos and not one of them was in focus when the zoom was used at full extension even with tripod .
p1053
aVThis all happened while on vacation .
p1054
aVWhen I returned home I mailed in camera to Fuji to be repaired .
p1055
aVIt was sent back with blur problem on left fixed but zoom was still fuzzy .
p1056
aVI informed them I was leaving on another trip and I needed a quick remedy .
p1057
aVThe only thing they could do was tell me to ship it in once again .
p1058
aVI reluctantly shipped in the camera and was sent a different one ... which also had problems with fuzzy zoom .
p1059
aVI called up in tears telling them the problem was not yet fixed and once again was told to send the camera back in .
p1060
aVI was assured they would fix and return it to me in time for my trip .
p1061
aVThey did overnight fed-ex me a shipping label , so I had some hope that they were on the ball .
p1062
aVBut I checked the Fed-Ex shipping number just before we left for our trip and I know Fuji had received it a couple days earlier but it had not been logged in by customer service .
p1063
aVWe were gone for a 10 day trip and I made it back home before the camera was returned from Fuji .
p1064
aVThey sent me a totally new camera and I 've been so disgusted with the whole experience that I wo n't use the camera .
p1065
aVI 'm very happy with the Nikon D80 we bought to use on the trip after the S9000 was not returned to us in time .
p1066
aVI do n't think I will ever buy another Fuji product because I now have serious doubts about their quality control and I 'm fed up with their customer service .
p1067
aVIf you do plan to buy this camera , buy it with plenty of time to work out the bugs before any important trips .
p1068
aVI would give this camera only one star after my experience if not for the fact that it takes great micro macro shots .
p1069
aVThat was one feature I was pleased with even when the left side was blurry .
p1070
aVIt would be the only reason I would hang onto this camera that has me so frustrated .
p1071
aVThe good points , great macro mode , fast start up , manual zoom faster and sucks less power than motor controlled zooms , swing out LCD .
p1072
aVThe bad points , if you get a clinker that slipped past quality control you will spend a lot of time cursing , wishing you had bought a different camera and getting substandard shots with a defective camera .
p1073
aa(lp1074
VWell I thought I was getting a great deal when I bought this camera .
p1075
aVIt came already fully charged and ready to go , so I popped in the 16 Mb MicroSD card which went in very easily , and I turned it on .
p1076
aVIt asked me a few basic questions like date\u005c/time etc. .
p1077
aV.
p1078
aVthen I was ready to go .
p1079
aVMy dog was close so I took a picture of him at about 24 '' distance .
p1080
aVThe picture looked a bit grainy in the little 1.8 `` display , but I thought it was just the way it came out on the screen .
p1081
aVI took another picture of my dog at 10 ' and it still showed up grainy .
p1082
aVAt this point I was checking all the features so I took 20 second video clips in each of the three video modes available .
p1083
aVThe Video seemed to look fine in the display and the brightness seemed to compensate well when I turned the lights off and on in the room .
p1084
aVI then easily popped out the USB port built into the camera , and I will say I have no evidence that it was flimsy , but I just had a feeling that this part would be the first to break .
p1085
aVI plugged it into my computer and ran the .
p1086
aVexe file that was required for the software and then some updates happened and I noticed Kodak also offered some other cool software for effects in video so I installed that too .
p1087
aVOK , I downloaded easily all of the pictures and videos .
p1088
aVThe videos looked great , all of them .
p1089
aVThe photos looked unbelievably bad , no lie here , I am not a photographer and I am not real picky about super clear photos , but these were ridiculously bad .
p1090
aVI checked the lens to make sure no plastic or spray paint was covering it and everything appeared normal .
p1091
aVIf you can stand it they have the ZM2 which is HD .
p1092
aVI loved all about this little gem , but I need to be able to tell what the picture is .
p1093
aVSpend a little more and get something you will be happy with .
p1094
aVMy ZM2 is on its way .
p1095
aa(lp1096
VThis is a great inexpensive product .
p1097
aVGood pair of binoculars just to throw in the truck and have when you need them .
p1098
aVThe optics are good for the price , slightly blury at full zoom , but not bad at all .
p1099
aVI would recomend this product to anyone looking for good binoculars at a great price .
p1100
aa(lp1101
VThese are excellent binoculars and a great value buy .
p1102
aVI wear glasses and I can leave them on and still use the binoculars in a moments notice for like bird watching or seated at a sports event .
p1103
aVI would n't trade them .
p1104
aa(lp1105
VJust got the camera a few days ago with the latest firmware .
p1106
aVLike everyone else , the APS-C sized sensor is amazing and the f2 .0 aperture produces nice shots with excellent bokeh .
p1107
aVUnfortunately the lack of image stabilization creates some shaky pictures .
p1108
aVBe sure to get a highs speed card so saving is faster .
p1109
aVIn addition , if you 've been following the the price of the x100 , you may 've noticed that there has been a significant price change of $ 200 .
p1110
aVLuckily , I purchased it directly from them and I was able to get a $ 200 refund without any hassel .
p1111
aa(lp1112
VI love how compact and easy to use this camera is .
p1113
aVThe touch screen works great , and the built-in User Guide is very easy to access and understand .
p1114
aVNow I just need to test how it works under water ...
p1115
aa(lp1116
Vthe image quality in a HDTV monitor is great , an additional battery is a good idea .
p1117
aVWith the joystick control is difficult to press without errors , anyway , easy to operate , light and very easy to pass from hdtv quality to tv quality ; the price-quality relation is very good .
p1118
aa(lp1119
VThis is a nice little camera .
p1120
aVTakes awesome pictures and video .
p1121
aVThe interface between the camera and my mac laptop however was not as easy as it should have been .
p1122
aVWe did get the issue resolved with a bit of persistance
p1123
aa(lp1124
VI was searching for a new camera for my girlfriend this being the 3 rd I will have purchased in as many years .
p1125
aVI reserched cameras and talked to people and this camera stood out as being not only easy to use but with controls good enough to take very excellent pics if you are and advanced user .
p1126
aVBuying it here on amazon with a 8 mb sd card and saved 50.00 at least .
p1127
aa(lp1128
VI bought this camcorder last Christmas and I 've loved it since .
p1129
aVI was looking for a reasonably priced Mini DV camcorder and came across this one at a local Sears .
p1130
aVIt felt nice and sturdy in my hands unlike the smaller ones offered by Sony and Panasonic .
p1131
aVI checked some reviews on it , found them to be good and bought it at J over in NYC .
p1132
aVThe video quality is nothing short of outstanding in good lighting thanks to the 1.33 megapixel CCD -LRB- a godsend in this price range -RRB- .
p1133

p1134
aVSony 's nightvision trumps the JVC in this respect because the picture becomes nothing but a bright , blurry mess in Night Alive mode .
p1135
aVI will invest in a video light to remedy this problem and I suggest that those considering this camcorder do likewise .
p1136
aVOverall this is still a terrific camcorder thanks to the 1.33 megapixel CCD not usually found in this price range .
p1137
aa(lp1138
VWe use it for photography lighting .
p1139
aVIt 's light weight and easy to carry .
p1140
aVThe light bulb gets very hot quickly , so it needs breaks every 5-7 minutes .
p1141
aVOverall , it 's a good value for the money because it comes with a rechargeable battery which comes handy when we shoot on location .
p1142
aa(lp1143
VI am new to the DSLR world , I was just looking for a quality , easy to use entry level camera .
p1144
aVI decided to go with the Nikon D3000 based on reviews and recommendations .
p1145
aVIt is incredibly easy to use right out of the box , the guide mode is great to help you out as well .
p1146
aVThe only thing missing with this camera is a live view , which to me is not a big deal , but it would be nice to have the option .
p1147
aVOther than that this camera is great , I 'm a beginner and I 've already taken some great photographs , so much better than the normal point and shoot .
p1148
aVI highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for an entry level DSLR .
p1149
aa(lp1150
VThe Panasonic DMC FZ40 is a very good camera .
p1151
aVI have just returned from a 3 week trip through the Amazon Jungle , Machu Picchu ,  Galapagos Islands .
p1152
aVDuring this trip I took over 3400 photos with this camera .
p1153
aVThe general construction of this camera held up very well in some pretty tough weather conditions .
p1154
aVEverything from heat  extreme humidity , high altitude  cold wet weather ,  open salt water conditions .
p1155
aVThe weight of this camera makes it easy to pack  hold .
p1156
aVThe zoom is incredible  the quality of pictures from average to good .
p1157
aVI shot most of the pictures in the program mode  about 400 in IA -LRB- auto -RRB- Little to no shutter lag  auto focus worked well most of the time .
p1158
aVMy issues are with the senor  processing .
p1159
aVSometimes this affected the quality of the picture or pictures in the view finder appearing to be in focus , only to get home  preview on a 22 '' monitor to find they were out of focus .
p1160
aVThe other issue for me was the 24X zoom .
p1161
aVMy experience shows that at the extreme end of this zoom most pictures were out of focus .
p1162
aVLikely to due to my inability to hand hold this camera still , even when braced against a firm object .
p1163
aVCamera shake can always be a problem .
p1164
aVAlso the auto focus had difficulty focusing at extreme distances .
p1165
aVI found it was best for me not to exceed 21X zoom .
p1166
aVI like this camera as a bridge camera  the fact you do n't have to pack a lot of glass -LRB- lens -RRB- .
p1167
aVHowever the photos I took with Nikon D40 on this trip were superior to the Panasonic .
p1168
aVAs the price points drop on this camera it will become a real bargin .
p1169
aVThe battery life is average , as I was able to shoot about 520 photos on a single charge .
p1170
aVAlso batteries were difficult to find , as I was forced to purchase -LRB- 3 -RRB- after market batteries for the price of 1 panasonic .
p1171
aVThe reason I gave it 3 stars is due to the focus issues , guessing about battery life ,  knowing now that for extreme zoom one should use a tripod .
p1172
aVThe low light capabilities of this camera are average .
p1173
aVThe flash is adequate with varied results .
p1174
aVLikely there are few cameras that compete with Panasonic in this price range .
p1175
aVI was happy to have this camera , as many of the wild life photos were much easier to take with the extend zoom .
p1176
aVJust know what you are purchasing  do n't expect DSLR quality in all your photos .
p1177
aa(lp1178
VEasy to use and setup , but the case decided to crack in half after a year of use .
p1179
aVSuperb video for its size .
p1180
aVHave taken to speeds of 150 + mounted behind a windscreen and it has held up .
p1181
aa(lp1182
VVery good set of binos for the price you pay .
p1183
aVOnly issue is that the cover for the eye piece does n't fit very well at all and keeps slipping off .
p1184
aVThat 's the only thing that prevents it from getting 5 stars .
p1185
aVHighly recommended .
p1186
aa(lp1187
VI bought two of these to replace 3 Canon EOS bodies - 1D Mk IV , 1D Mk II , and 5D Mk II .
p1188
aVIt was painful to switch systems from Canon to Nikon , but worth it for my interests .
p1189
aVI shoot a lot of high school sports and the venues are not brightly lit .
p1190
aVThe D3s definitely has lower noise at high ISO settings .
p1191
aVIt also seems to have more reliable autofocus performance .
p1192
aVCurrently , Canon does n't offer a full frame sports body , so I ended up carrying a 5D Mk II for wide angle shots , in addition to the 1D Mk II  IV bodies .
p1193
aVNow I can carry 2 bodies instead of 3 .
p1194
aVThe recently announced EOS 1Dx may solve these problems , but wo n't be out until March .
p1195
aVFor now , at least , the D3s is unmatched for sports shooters .
p1196
aa(lp1197
VI 've owned the HX9V for about 10 months and it has provided the best video quality overall .
p1198
aVIt has better low light quality and image stabilization than the Panasonic FZ150 , Panasonic G3 , and even the Sony Nex-5N .
p1199
aVThe only time the Nex-5N could match the stabilization was when I used the 18-200mm lens , but that is very heavy and costs $ 800 by itself .
p1200
aVAdvantages over a traditional camcorder : - Compact - Wide angle starts at 25mm -LRB- most camcorder start at 30 or 35mm - 16x optical zoom - Amazing active image stabilization - Class leading low light video performance - Photo quality far better than stills mode on camcorders Disadvantages over a traditional camcorder : - No flip out screen or viewfinder - Smaller battery capacity So thanks to the HX9V , I 'll never need to consider a dedicated camcorder again .
p1201
aVI use the 1080p 60p mode which is brilliant .
p1202
aVLooks amazing on my HDTV played from either the camera or PlayStation 3 .
p1203
aVAlso looks great on my computer .
p1204
aa(lp1205
VI could n't be happier with the camera .
p1206
aVIt 's in perfect condition and came with a bunch of accessories it would n't normally have .
p1207
aVIt 's lightweight and has great shutter speed for a point-and-shoot .
p1208
aVShipped quickly , too !
p1209
aVThanks for everything .
p1210
aa(lp1211
VGreat camera ~ and I love the powerful zoom ~ but it seems that i have problems with it 's auto mode , the color does n't come out right with the auto mode
p1212
aa(lp1213
VThis is a great product , very easy to use and setup ... once you figure out that you ca n't use the screws that are provided .
p1214
aVYou will need to obtain a different set of screws\u005c/anchors in order to attach the mounts .
p1215
aVI struggled with what was provided before giving up and using anchors and screws that were much easier to use .
p1216
aVIf you are mounting into dry wall , get a good set of dry wall anchors -LRB- the kind that look like large screws and thread into the wall which you then screw the bolt into work best -RRB- ; this will save you about 30 to 45 minutes of frustration .
p1217
aVIf you are mounting into concrete , cinder block , or something similar go with bolts designed for that material .
p1218
aVOnce you get past that issue , everything is smooth sailing .
p1219
aa(lp1220
VI personally love this camera but there are major flaws that do not effect me .
p1221
aVThe flash is located in a terrible spot , right below your left pointer finger .
p1222
aVIf you plan on using flash do not buy this camera .
p1223
aVThe camera says 16mp but its a blurry\u005c/graining 16mp when you fully zoom in .
p1224
aVWith that said if you plan to take pictures solely for facebook and sending to people it 's perfect .
p1225
aVIndoor pictures come in amazing if you use the right settings , outdoor pictures are crystal clear .
p1226
aVLow light pictures are acceptable .
p1227
aVConclusion : I bought this for $ 77 off Amazon and since I do n't print off images or use flash I consider this camera a steal .
p1228
aa(lp1229
VI own a Canon digital SLR and bought this as a `` portable '' camera .
p1230
aVAfter reading the reviews , I expected that this camera would take good pics , albeit not in the same league as my 10D .
p1231
aVHowever , to date , I have found the pics grainy and lacking color detail .
p1232
aVI have switched to manual and set the ISO to 50 .
p1233
aVPerhaps that will solve the problem .
p1234
aVI suspect camera may be defective because no one else has suggested the pics are grainy .
p1235
aVOne other problem -- the camera does not have a battery meter , so you can not tell when the battery needs re-charging .
p1236
aVThis is a major design flaw .
p1237
aVOn a good note -- the build quality is excellent .
p1238
aVThe camera is responsive , although there is a lag with the pics and the buffer .
p1239
aVI may wait for Kyocera to perfect their ultra-compacts , because they have recently developed a chip that will load directly to the SD media , and lag is not an issue .
p1240
aa(lp1241
VI was pretty happy with this unit .
p1242
aVPictures taken are of fairly decent quality .
p1243
aVVideo was also fine , considering the source and the tradeoffs you make .
p1244
aVPacking it along for various trips\u005c/adventures was a pleasure .
p1245
aVBUT ... It 's dead .
p1246
aVI 've owned it for 3 months , and it died .
p1247
aVNo rough treatment .
p1248
aVWaterproofing has never been put to the test .
p1249
aVNo drops ... and it is no longer with us .
p1250
aVAfter the last USB connection to my computer and disconnecting -LRB- properly -RRB- it will not power on .
p1251
aVPlugged in or via battery power , the unit is completely unresponsive .
p1252
aVIt is now a rubberized purple paperweight .
p1253
aVToo bad .
p1254
aVAmazon return is not an option at this point .
p1255
aVI will research the options with Kodak and post an update here .
p1256
aa(lp1257
VI bought this camera as a second one for my husband and daughter .
p1258
aVIt is really easy to use and takes wonderful photos .
p1259
aVI have a 512 mb SD memory card and set on 6.1 mp it stores up to 419 pictures .
p1260
aVAt 7.1 mp it holds up to 372 pictures .
p1261
aa(lp1262
VIf you 're looking a simple , point  shoot camera that is easy to use and will produce great pics ... I doubt you will find a better one in this price range !
p1263
aVVery impressed !!
p1264
aa(lp1265
VI searched for months for the perfect video camera , and this was it .
p1266
aVIt has every feature I wanted except the external light , which isnt necessary since it can record very well with cats eye in total darkness .
p1267
aVI never had a pixellation problem , and I used Panasonic miniDV tapes .
p1268
aVI 've had this camera for about 5 months , and just recently it started having a problem .
p1269
aVWhen I put a tape in , it says `` Eject the Cassette '' and will not play or record a tape .
p1270
aV... Also , it would be nice if the camera were about half the size , and had microphone output .
p1271
aa(lp1272
V1 .
p1273
aVThis camera did not wind up being compatible with either my Mac OR my PC .
p1274
aVEven after downloading the updated drivers and installing the software , I do n't get anything .
p1275
aVCa n't access it from the ` My Computer ' area , either .
p1276
aVSo there is no way to actually use the thing .
p1277
aV2 .
p1278
aVThe camera contains about ten of those ITTY BITTY screws that are really easy to lose .
p1279
aVFor a child 's camera .
p1280
aVSo if the batteries run down while you 're trying to get the pictures off , you wind up losing half the screws -LRB- which are also nigh-impossible to put BACK into the camera -RRB- .
p1281
aVKeep in mind , this is marketed for children .
p1282
aV: \u005c/ I am not amused .
p1283
aV3 .
p1284
aVMy daughter was very , very sad and frustrated , because she was looking forward to having a camera of her very own .
p1285
aVWaste of time , waste of money .
p1286
aVI do n't know who thought this was even a good idea .
p1287
aa(lp1288
VI 've been using the camera for 6 months now almost every day .
p1289
aVI really like it , and would recommend it .
p1290
aVIts amazing for low-light , and with zoom I could even photograph stars while being hand-held .
p1291
aVI listed a lot of cons , but the Likes definitely outweigh them .
p1292
aVThe HDR , auto , and nightime settings are what I use 90 % of the time - and they work really well .
p1293
aVThe night-time setting is so good that I do n't even bother with a tripod anymore = -RRB- Likes : - very little blur even when handheld at night-time - HDR is amazing - 10fps helped me get some amazing shots - video is very high quality - 16x zoom !
p1294
aVI can photograph the moon and stars .

aV- panorama is a must-have Cons : - slight fish-eye lensing ; results in fat faces on the image sides - HDR causes ghosts to appear if anything moves - panorama does a horrible job at stitching curved lines - panorama is difficult to use , requiring perfect motions or it fails - no mid-quality video option - propriety video format - video capture takes several seconds to work after pushing button - video capture button is hard to push - does not work with Windows XP SP2 , but works fine in Linux - after 6 months use , the data cable became flakey - proprietary cable , batteries -LRB- and overpriced at that -RRB- - the 3D is a useless gimic ... its more like 2.2 D - the background blurring function has noticeable negative artifacts - HDR should be on the rotating option wheel , I use it all the time - fireworks setting results in horrible fireworks shots , other settings work much better - pet setting does n't do anything noticeable - 16mega pixel my arse ; images have terrible jpeg compression artifacts -LRB- all Cybershot cameras do -RRB- - needs color-enhancement setting - no RAW format - no selectable flash brightness - battery door opens by itself occasionally edit : The cable connection to download pictures is horrible .
p1296
aVI have to place it down just right , tuck something under the cable , and avoid even looking at it wrong or the data connection will fail .
p1297
aVI take very good care of it , yet it 's failing on it 's own .
p1298

VI like this camcorder because of 2 options that no other camcorder has .
p1300
aV1 .
p1301
aVCan take pictures 2 .
p1302
aVHas that light in the front that let you shoot in the night .
p1303
aVI will highly recommend this camera .
p1304
aVAdded in 2010 : this review was done back in 06 ' so this camcorder was one of the few that could take pictures and had flash .
p1305
aVThis camera is still a good buy for anyone .
p1306
aVmine still works perfectly .
p1307
aa(lp1308
VThis camera worked beautifully .
p1309
aVFor the sale price , the images taken were fantastic .
p1310
aVIs one of the higher end camera choices for the price range .
p1311
aVMy only complaint is the image on the LCD screen is horrible before the picture is taken .
p1312
aVFor example , the image is fuzzy , lights look like minature suns an the quality looks like it 's from a 1.3 megapixel camera .
p1313
aVHowever , once the photo is taken , the image is amazingly high quality and all of those problems go away .
p1314
aVOverall , if you are looking for a simple and inexpensive camera , this is the way to go .
p1315
aa(lp1316
VPicked this up recently and love it and great DSLR to learn from .
p1317
aVYou can never go wrong with Canon point to shoot to SLR cameras including ZR camcorders too .
p1318
aVCANON all the way !
p1319
aa(lp1320
VI had one of the 2nd Generation Flip Minos  used it a lot .
p1321
aVThen I went to Hawaii on vacation , where it was stolen from the trunk of our rental car .
p1322
aVUpon returning to the hotel , I got online  found this 3rd Generation Flip Mino for a great price .
p1323
aVIt arrived at my home around the same time I returned .
p1324
aVIt 's great .
p1325
aVSame ease of use .
p1326
aVSame great captures .
p1327
aVSurprisingly good stereo reproduction .
p1328
aVIt 's a shame Cisco has abandoned development .
p1329
aVThere 's a definite advantage to using these as opposed to a smart phone .
p1330
aVYou can mount the Flip on a tripod and shoot for 2 hours while using your phone for all the other things it does .
p1331
aVI ca n't imagine NOT having one of these .
p1332
aa(lp1333
V
p1334
aa(lp1335
VI regret taking these along on a trip .
p1336
aVWhite reflections , especially on the right side , block the image and I also see a haze around the edges which further limits the view .
p1337
aVHighly annoying to try to see the image past these shortcomings , even at the ten dollar price I paid .
p1338
aVAs far as I am concerned they are useless at this point .
p1339
aVOnly one star for the case , which I 'll be able to use either for the pair that I hope to find to replace these or for my GPS unit .
p1340
aVI purchased these from a local retailer based on my good experience with the Celestron 15x70 binoculars thinking this might also be a good pair in this category at a good price .
p1341
aa(lp1342
VThis little thing is a awesome camera !
p1343
aVWhen i first got it i could n't believe !
p1344
aVthe quality of the camera and its accessories .
p1345
aVI own a Kawasaki ZZR600 and you have almost endless camera angles with the mounts provided you can even put it on your helmet which is awesome .
p1346
aVThe sound quality is outstanding for such a small camera , i was so surprised when i plugged it in the TV for the first time and could actually hear the sound of the engine and not just wind .
p1347
aVDownloading to the computer is simple but i ran into trouble when trying to edit it but I 'm not as tech-savvy as others , so I 'm sure with some help i could do it easy and become a Pro at GoPro camera editing !
p1348
aVOver all this thing is great !
p1349
aVbut i do recommend getting a video editing program and 2 or more 8 gigabyte SD memory cards , depending on how long you wish to film and at what resolution GoPro for life !
p1350
aa(lp1351
VFor many years , I used a Nikon FG , which was a mid-level camera .
p1352
aVTook great pictures if you knew what you were doing , but of course it was a film camera .
p1353
aVThen came digital cameras .
p1354
aVFor the last 10 years , I was basically using point and shoot cameras , which were great for general landscapes .
p1355
aVNo longer being interested in standing in darkrooms inhaling photo processing chemicals , I opted for a digital SLR where I could do any further processing on the computer .
p1356
aVAs a birthday gift to myself , I got the Nikon D3100 .
p1357
aVTook it out the first few days and achieved less than thrilling results ; my point  shoots gave me better pictures .
p1358
aVSo I took a look at the manual which helped only marginally .
p1359
aVI do n't think it was orginally written in English and may have lost some in the translation .
p1360
aVCommon sense told me that Nikon could n't have put out a $ 500 + camera that only takes so-so pictures .
p1361
aVI looked on Amazon and found 3 books written especially for this camera , and I bought one .
p1362
aVhref="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470648651/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/184-3007056-8008653"> Nikon D3100 Digital Field Guide  .
p1363
aVGoing over just the first few chapters of this book made a huge difference .
p1364
aVI 'm now getting incredible images .
p1365
aVMy problem was that photography had progressed immensely while I was playing around with the point  shoots .
p1366
aVThis camera takes advantage of these new advances , plus it sounds like it 's made a few advances of its own .
p1367
aVIt 's a very sophisticated camera , but it 's also initially complicated , and there is a learning curve .
p1368
aVThe book explains the camera in detail using plain English , and as a result I 'm learning a lot about the camera and about digital photography in general , even though I thought I knew a lot .
p1369
aVI am only now beginning to appreciate this camera .
p1370
aVIt provides you with an incredible amount of control , from very subtle to blatantly obvious .
p1371
aVThe display on the back of the camera provides technical information , easy to use menus , and allows you to zoom in on the images to make sure they are in focus and to check on exposure of details or shadows .
p1372
aVThe 18-55mm lens included in the kit is great except that the maximum aperature opening is 3.5 -LRB- I was used to 1.8 on my old Nikon -RRB- .
p1373
aVThe auto focusing gives you many options , and when used correctly , the focusing is perfect and sharp .
p1374
aVAs with all autofocus lenses , the manual focusing is touchy and not at all like the old manual lenses , however , I 've really not had much need to focus manually , so it 's not much of an issue .
p1375
aVAlthough it can be used as such , it 's not a point  shoot camera , and therefore it is somewhat bulky .
p1376
aVAnd unlike my old FG , it 's mostly plastic .
p1377
aVI think that 's life nowdays ; plastic is king .
p1378
aVThe neckstrap is kind of cheesy .
p1379
aVThe camera kit comes with a battery -LRB- I might get a second in case , but I 'm surprised at how long it does last -RRB- , and a plug-in charger .
p1380
aVIncluded in the box is software for manipulating your pictures on the computer .
p1381
aVI have n't installed this yet because I use href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YGMEAQ/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/184-3007056-8008653"> Adobe Photoshop Elements 9 -LRB- Win\u005c/Mac -RRB-  , although at some point I may try it just for fun .
p1382
aVThere is also another disk which is an extended version of the printed manual ; basically it suffers from the same problem as the printed one .
p1383
aVWhat does n't come with the camera is the USB cable , which I think stinks .
p1384
aVFortunately I had one from an old Palm Pilot that worked .
p1385
aVThe camera , by the way , does include 2 ferrite cores .
p1386
aVI had to research what those were ; they wrap around near one end of the USB cable to prevent interference when uploading your pictures .
p1387
aVConsidering using it because without it I kept getting uploading errors .
p1388
aVI did n't plan on writing this much , but really there is much to say about this camera .
p1389
aVBottom line is that I really like it .
p1390
aa(lp1391
VThe camera is nice and small making it easy to take on vacation or just about anywhere .
p1392
aVThe camera is makes it really easy to upload photos with the share feature .
p1393
aVThis camera also takes decent photos as long as the subject is n't moving .
p1394
aVIt 's not a top of the line camera , but for times when you just need a nice little camera for site seeing or for vacation it is well worth the money .
p1395
aa(lp1396
VWe have enjoyed this new camera for almost a month .
p1397
aVIt takes good pictures and functions well .
p1398
aVWe are pleased with every part of the purchasing process to include the price .
p1399
aa(lp1400
VThis camera was a great everyday camera .
p1401
aVI 've had bigger and better cameras but for a camera that fits in my pocket it was awesome .
p1402
aVthe video quality is great but could be a little better .
p1403
aVlooked fine enough on my 60 '' Led DLP .
p1404
aVthe pictures were great and the battery life was also very good .
p1405
aVthe camera is light enough to not be cumbersome but heavy enough to not feel cheap -LRB- crappy -RRB- .
p1406
aVeverything is in past tense because i lost the camera last Halloween .
p1407
aVI 've tried a few other cameras that i 've had to return because they just did n't match up to the experience i had with this camera .
p1408
aVtrial with other cameras was because my wife wanted a cheaper camera and cheaper turned out to be just that .
p1409
aVshe finally broke and decided to get this camera again , it makes me more than happy .
p1410
aa(lp1411
VThis camera does exactly what i wanted it to .
p1412
aVit takes regular pictures and video with daylight or the flash and if you want to take pictures in complete darkness , all you have to do is flip the IR switch .
p1413
aVi did buy a new HD card for it , the original pictures with the first card were pretty fuzzy .
p1414
aVeveryone should have a faster card anyway ... the camera is very small and lightweight .
p1415
aVat first , the plastic makes you think it is a cheap little kids toy , but it works great and i love my new camera .
p1416
aVwell worth the money .
p1417
aVwell , i wrote all of that ^ ^ before i used it .
p1418
aVafter i used it once ... well , i got to use it once .
p1419
aVit is broken .
p1420
aVi do n't know what 's wrong with it .
p1421
aVit wo n't charge , it wo n't turn on .
p1422
aVnow i belive it is the little kids toy that it feels like .
p1423
aVthe company that i bought it from refuses to return emails or assist me with the problem .
p1424
aa(lp1425
VI had been debating on whether to get the sd900 or the sd800is .
p1426
aVI ended up going with the sd800is instead because it had image stabilization and because I have heard that the 7 megapixel is n't to far of a difference from the 10 .
p1427
aVWhen I got home and used it , I was so surprised .
p1428
aVThe pictures come out super clear and are very excellent especially when doing close ups .
p1429
aVI have a sony 7.2 camera and it could not even compare to the sharpness I saw in the sd800is .
p1430
aVI am now a Canon fan !!
p1431
aa(lp1432
VWell the network setup is very easy .
p1433
aVI did it all in Ubuntu Linux .
p1434
aVI have it sending images to my FTP server just fine .
p1435
aVI must admit I have NOT used their software .
p1436
aVIt may take care of the problems I have with the camera .
p1437
aVThe problems I found : The network SSID or passwords CAN NOT use the '' + '' plus sign .
p1438
aVIt turns them into a '' '' -LRB- space -RRB- .
p1439
aVThis caused me some problems , but do-able .
p1440
aVThe camera is setup for night vision .
p1441
aVThis means that during the day the colors do n't look good .
p1442
aVGreen leaves and grass are closer to purple .
p1443
aVThe night image cam be nice and bright .
p1444
aVHere in lies the problem .
p1445
aVI am having trouble getting the brightness and contrast set to a good all round `` looks OK '' setting .
p1446
aVThe automatic brightness does n't seam to adjust very well .
p1447
aVSome times it is too bright or too dark .
p1448
aVAs clouds pass this causes problems .
p1449
aVNext the Alarm sensitivity is very poor .
p1450
aVWith it set to 10 , least sensitivity setting , it triggers on tree leaves moving .
p1451
aVYou do n't have any zones to set .
p1452
aVOn lower settings it just triggers all the time .
p1453
aVA 67 degree field of view is n't bad .
p1454
aVI will need 2 cameras to cover my front yard , it is n't big either .
p1455
aVBottom line for the price it is n't too bad .
p1456
aVI am going to keep looking for a better camera myself .
p1457
aa(lp1458
VOk , maybe I 've gone a little overboard there with the title , but I 've been longing for this kind of camera for years .
p1459
aVIt came close with the Olympus E-P1 .
p1460
aVThey married style with substance , however - with a sensor that small , there 's still much to be desired for a professional .
p1461
aVGreat camera for prosumers though and still in my bag .
p1462
aVThe x100 truly marries style with substance .
p1463
aVThe retro styling of the camera , coupled with current digital photography technology , makes this camera a stunning piece of equipment .
p1464
aVLet 's get price out of the way ... no need to complain about how much it costs .
p1465
aVThe image quality this camera produces comes close to that of my 5dmkII and 35L in which this combo is nearly triple the price - not to mention triple the size .
p1466
aVObviously , that combo offers much more than great image quality , but I think that because the x100 can come close to that , it 's priced well .
p1467
aVYou 've heard a lot about this camera already so I 'm not going to repeat anything you can find via a google search , but I will say this camera has been a joy to use since day 1 .
p1468
aVNot because I was looking for it 's faults , but because I was learning to differentiate faults versus learning .
p1469
aVThe x100 is quick , responsive and versatile .
p1470
aVI can use it on family events , portrait sessions or traveling .
p1471
aVIf the big guns learn anything from this camera , it 's that smaller does not mean more limited .
p1472
aVI would love to see a professional series slr body in a small figure .
p1473
aVI loathe carrying around my 85L .
p1474
aa(lp1475
VThis is really a nice HD camcorder -LRB- except for low dynamic range -RRB- , but for still photography is disappointing .
p1476
aVWhat 's the point of having a 16 MP sensor when pictures are so soft -LRB- whey look as watercolor paintings when scrutinized -RRB- , and can not be cropped accordingly .
p1477
aVSony went overboard with noise reduction , so the effective resolution is more like 8-10 MP and not 16 MP .
p1478
aVLousy camera , but a great camcorder .
p1479
aa(lp1480
VI have been very happy with this purchase .
p1481
aVI take it everywhere .
p1482
aVThe camera itself is very light , it is very easy to use and very user friendly .
p1483
aVIt has stood up to very cold temperatures and very hot temperatures in my recent world travels , and the photo quality is amazing .
p1484
aVI do sometimes worry about the durability because it does not have the tough housing of some of the higher end Canon models , but for the price I think it is very hard to beat .
p1485
aVI would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is getting serious about their photography .
p1486
aVOne other consideration is that there are so many available lenses for Canon APS-C cameras .
p1487
aVCanon has a large selection and many offerings for different budgets .
p1488
aVThere are also several offerings from Sigma and Tamron which can be very nice -LRB- the Tamron 18-270mm superzoom is very nice , inexpensive , light , and while not perfect is very versatile and fun to use for most basic travel photography -RRB- .
p1489
aVI have a few friends with equivalent Nikon DSLR 's and have found that while the image quality is about the same , lenses are a little more expensive -LRB- in rare instances a lot more expensive -RRB- , and a little more difficult to find .
p1490
aVReally , you ca n't go wrong with either Nikon or Canon .
p1491
aVSometimes I think choosing a DSLR becomes like joining a religion , both are great and the small differences between them seem to fit different people -LRB- or you get used to the little differences and that becomes your reference point -RRB- .
p1492
aVI thought of this camera as a stepping stone to others in the future .
p1493
aVI bought it to learn about DSLR 's and become a better photographer , but I 've been so happy with it I have n't wanted to go further .
p1494
aVI like to think I will eventually graduate to a more complex camera with a full size sensor , but as a fairly critical -LRB- of myself -RRB- , amateur photographer , I have a lot of fun , take some pretty impressive shots , and I think for the cost it has many features that one really ca n't find on a similarly priced camera .
p1495
aVIf you are like me and just want something to start taking very nice shots pretty much right out of the box , this camera would not disappoint .
p1496
aVI absolutely love it .
p1497
aa(lp1498
VI love this thing .
p1499
aVI think it blows my GoPro out of the water , but I have found one flaw in it .
p1500
aVThe wind noise gets pretty loud at about 30MPH .
p1501
aVIf you really want to knit pick you could say they should include more mounts for the cam , but it is what it is .
p1502
aVI can say that the goggle mount is solid and hasnt given me any problems yet .
p1503
aVI also went with this over the new `` ROAM '' because it has a removable battery so you can always have a backup battery ready to go .
p1504
aa(lp1505
Vset up was tricky , but once they are set up , i have a reliable product .
p1506
aVthe tricky set up could even have been my controller , and not even the fault of the reviewed product .
p1507
aa(lp1508
VI started my photo hobby with a Rebel XS , and quickly outgrew it .
p1509
aVA friend of mine picked up the 60D with the 28-135mm IS USM , for a great price , and i wanted to jump on that wagon .
p1510
aVBy the time i was ready , the price on that package jumped astronomically .
p1511
aVSo , after alot of research i found this setup , and was sold almost immediately .
p1512
aVI was nervous about the lens , because i read alot of reviews about the `` terrible vignetting '' that this lens caused , but i bought it anyway .
p1513
aVAfter a few days of use , i will say , without a doubt , this lens is great for a kit lens .
p1514
aVThe UD motor is n't very loud , i would say comparable to the USM .
p1515
aVThis lens takes great shots throught the focal range , and i would n't trade it for any other kit lens .
p1516
aVThe camera is exactly what i knew it to be .
p1517
aVAnd after playing with my buddies 60D , it was a seamless transition from something like that light weight starter DSLR to this camera , and i went from alright shots , to amazing shots overnight !
p1518
aa(lp1519
VSo after reading and re-reading all the reviews , I sprung for the cam .
p1520
aVArrived fast , pop it open and tape away .
p1521
aVWithin 30 minutes I had the dreaded pixel problem and the dirty head indicator .
p1522
aVSo I did what another user suggested , just recorded and played it back for about an hour .
p1523
aVI used Panasonic tape in LP format .
p1524
aVToday it works like a charm .
p1525
aVThe pic and camera are excellent .
p1526
aVPic is so much better then the price , you can do some many things it will take awhile to figure it all out .
p1527
aVThe memory card is great , bam pictures right into my PC .
p1528
aVHolds like 250 pics in econmy mode .
p1529
aVWhat more can you possible ask for !
p1530
aV... and all for 400 $ give or take .
p1531
aVI can go on and on , but I will definatly let you all know if it starts messing up again , if not this might be one of the best bargins out there , wipes Sony , JVC and the rest away .
p1532
aa(lp1533
VThis a very fine camera .
p1534
aVIt is worth every penny I pad for it .
p1535
aVGreat Quality for a reasonable price .
p1536
aa(lp1537
VI love this camera .
p1538
aVI 've had an older verison of the Kodak EasyShare Z series point and shoot camera .
p1539
aVIt was just 7.1 MP zoom and 12X zoom and I have some of the most beautiful pictures of the Grand Canyon , Bryce and Zion .
p1540
aVThe zoom was great for a close ups of the amazing mosiacs in the Aya Sophia in Istanbul .
p1541
aVI decided I was ready to jump to a DSLR .
p1542
aVMy old film SLR is a Nikon and I could use the lenses .
p1543
aVSo I window shopped .
p1544
aVFirst there was the price , I expected that , then because I hike when I travel I found a lens that would be versitile .
p1545
aVI have a backpack , but I did n't want to carry a camera bag too .
p1546
aVTotal about $ 1400 .
p1547
aVI did n't know if I could justify the expense .
p1548
aVI do this for fun , not for a living .
p1549
aVI went back to the Kodak to see what their newer models were like .
p1550
aVMy old one was one of the top rated ones in Consumer Reports .
p1551
aVI checked out the Kodak Z990 , $ 200 .
p1552
aVIt 's a great deal .
p1553
aVI 'm still learning the Kodak Z990 .
p1554
aVI bought a very fast Class 10 video card and I 've been playing .
p1555
aVI seem to have found a little glitch , which shows up when I review shots .
p1556
aVIt does n't effect the pictures , even though the multi colored screen freaked me out at first .
p1557
aVIt feels like a DSLR and is larger and a lot heavier then my Z712 , which I still love .
p1558
aVI will need a tripod or monopod for long zooms .
p1559
aVI was having trouble holding it still enough .
p1560
aVI 've experimented with the different automatic settings and I 'm still working on natural light vs flash preferences .
p1561
aVI do n't like overlighting a scene .
p1562
aVI did get some amazing shots of a native American dance , swirling .
p1563
aVSo I 'm anxious to try more action shots .
p1564
aVI 'm heading back to hike Escalente next summer , we 'll see how we do .
p1565
aVHave n't tried the HD video yet .
p1566
aVI had a great time with the video on the Z712 .
p1567
aVThis is not like my little Casio , which I wear around my neck when I bike .
p1568
aVThe Casio is barely better then my iphone .
p1569
aVI 've learned to have a couple cameras when I travel , since you never know .
p1570
aVThis feels and shoots like a real camera -LRB- a DSLR -RRB- .
p1571
aVI think it 's a bargain .
p1572
aVI 've had great luck with my Kodak Z712 and I think the Z990 will be a good successor .
p1573
aa(lp1574
VGreat in low light and for landscapes .
p1575
aVLove the ability to manually set everything .
p1576
aVBUT : Totally worthless for anything that moves , because the continuous drive is so slow I could paint a picture faster .
p1577
aVIt 's a shame .
p1578
aVWith a faster continuous drive , this would be a great little camera .
p1579
aVAnother feature I find myself wanting is tethered shooting , which did existed in earlier G models .
p1580
aVFinally , a wider aperture would be nice .
p1581
aVBut my biggest gripe is the slow drive .

aVI wish I bought the S95 .

aa(lp1584
VUsed as a point and shoot with a high speed SD card and set on auto it snaps off frames like a quality film camera .
p1585
aVThe built in image stabilization also makes it easy to make pan shots during sports events or for a quick opp shot .

aVDo some reading and all kinds of interesting uses offer themselves .

VSo I recently purchased this product to do some video projects .
p1591
aVI was a little hesitant at first to purchase this because I always seem to buy camcorders with too much audio noise or some other annoying flaw .
p1592
aVIt has been a couple weeks since I 've been using this .
p1593
aVI am `` very '' pleased with this product .
p1594
aVNo annoying buzz in my recordings and the video quality is excellent .
p1595
aVThis certainly is n't going to produce the same results as those $ 3,000.00 USD camcorders will .
p1596
aVBut grading this compared to one of those is just silly .
p1597
aVI 've noticed this with a lot of other reviews I 've read on camcorders .
p1598
aVPeople tend to call the product garbage because it does n't compare with those super high end models .
p1599
aVI 'm currently using mine for producing 1080p videos and I 'll admit I have n't bothered with the still image photos of this product yet .
p1600
aVBut the video quality for the price range of these camcorders are top notch !
p1601
aVI also read the image stabilization is bad but I really have n't Encountered much of that .
p1602
aVBut I have a very steady hand and use a tripod most of the time .
p1603
aVThe only problem I 've encountered is that sometimes the auto-adjustment will take a moment to regain focus on objects that get too close to the camera .
p1604
aVAnyways , I 'm not a professional Cameraman so take what I say with a grain of salt .
p1605
aVHowever , from my `` average Joe '' point of view I 'm really pleased with this product .
p1606
aa(lp1607
VI am very pleased with the promptness of this order .
p1608
aVI received exactly when they said it would be here and I love the different screens built into the focus I can use in my picture taking .
p1609
aa(lp1610
VI was reasonably happy with this camera even though the image quality was poor and the touchscreen did not work as it should , the camera was purchased for its waterproof capabilities and it served its purpose for a while .
p1611
aVIt was not heavily used when the 1 year warranty expired and a week later a piece broke off of the lower right corner of the body .
p1612
aVIt was an unprovoked and not neglected .
p1613
aVI did some research and this happens frequently with this camera .
p1614
aVAfter sending it into the company they said that it would be a $ 250 repair , that they could n't just replace that one piece , it had to be a full repair -LRB- meaning that every little time I scratched it , they used it against me -RRB- .
p1615
aVI had heard horror stories about the company and customer service , but we remained loyal customers , until today .
p1616
aVI am extremely disappointed , and regret the day I made this purchase .
p1617
aVI wish I could say otherwise , but the camera and the company is a bad choice .
p1618
aVStay away .
p1619
aVA few reviewers with the same problem .
p1620

Vused once in a month .
p1623
aVtook pictures inside of 1 year old grandson .
p1624
aVdisappointed with picture quality , med to low light , pictures were blurry .
p1625
aVout over 11 pictures only 4 came out acceptable .
p1626
aVresponse time of camera was slow .
p1627
aVwill play around with settings and see what happens .
p1628
aa(lp1629
VI 've had this camera since 1999 when I first started taking B photography class .
p1630
aVI believe that this is a great camera for people to learn basic photography .
p1631
aVAlthough I moved up to Nikon F80 and Nikon D40 I still take this camera out for a spin once in a while -LRB- a family member closed his camera store and gave me boxes on 35mm films -RRB- .
p1632
aVI fully recommend this camera to anybody that wants to learn basic photography .
p1633
aa(lp1634
VI used this camera to take pictures at Niagara falls and it was capturing both the people and the background rather well .
p1635
aVI am satisfied with it .
p1636
aa(lp1637
VJust as everyone else stated , this is a great compact , cool looking camera .
p1638
aVPictures have turned out okay .
p1639
aVSome were blurry but I suspect it may be the lighting .
p1640
aVOutdoor pics were clear as the sky .
p1641
aVHowever , I have a lot of problem with loading and unloading the film .
p1642
aVSometimes the camera would keep rolling sounding like it would load the film but when it stops making noise the cartridge symbol blinks asking you to put in the film .
p1643
aVAnd when it finally loads correctly and finishes rewinding the film , the door gets stuck and would not open .
p1644
aVIt 's quite frustrating .
p1645
aVI 'm going to get a refund and I suggest not getting this camera at all especially for this price .
p1646
aVYou should probably go with their digital elph camera instead .
p1647
aa(lp1648
VLet me start by saying , I love my 7D .
p1649
aVIt 's the most athletic camera I own - 8 FPS , killer autofocus system , ISO expandable to 12,800 , all of the canon lenses - and 3rd party lenses , almost any accessory out there has a canon version .
p1650
aVSome of the best photo 's I 've taken have been with the 7D .
p1651
aVNot to mention , the cinematic quality of the 1080p video capability in conjunction with all of those said lenses .
p1652
aVSo why am I a bit let down in the image quality department ?
p1653
aVIts very simple , even though the 7D has high ISO capability , I find that cramming 18 MPs on to an APS-C sensor is MP overkill .
p1654
aVI 've found that noise levels are more acceptable on my Rebel XSi than my 7D .
p1655
aVAt ISO 100 , the 7D is awesome , its awesome all the way to 1,000 .
p1656
aVHowever , when I set -LRB- and I do n't that often -RRB- the ISO to auto - the 7D constantly bumps the ISO to 3,200 - the results are some really noisy images .
p1657
aVGranted - Noise Ninja does a great job in post production in reducing noise , but the fact is the 7D is sold as a low light camera - implying excellent low light performance - and the performance IS good -LRB- focus , metering , etc -RRB- but the resulting images are -LRB- in my mind -RRB- somewhat disappointing .
p1658
aVSo I switch to full manual mode and work with ISO 100 and pretend there 's not any other ISO setting and I 've been much happier .
p1659
aVI also use f\u005c/2 .8 and low light primes -LRB- 85 1.8 , 50 1.4 , etc. -RRB- to take advantage of the 7D 's low light capabilities .
p1660
aVOn the plus side the 7D is simply loaded with features - video , 8FPS , custom settings , does n't need an additional transmitter to trigger remote speed lites , killer auto focus system , etc , etc , etc. .
p1661
aVBut if your goal is just great image quality , you might consider spending your money on a used first generation 5D .
p1662
aVIt takes better pictures .
p1663
aVIf you need a more capable camera -LRB- with really good image quality -RRB- like for sporting events then The 7D is best suited for you .
p1664
aVIf you take portraits or families on the beach then get the 5D , and use the left over money to put toward a high quality prime lens .
p1665
aVThink of the 7D as an ` athlete ' - think if the 5D as an ` artist ' - depending on your needs , that 's the one to go with ...
p1666
aa(lp1667
VGot this camera just in time for my sons birthday .
p1668
aVIt is SO easy to use , SO small , and the quality is SO good !!!
p1669
aVWe are having a lot of fun with it .
p1670
aVThe software is easy to use and I am impressed with the battery life .
p1671
aVOverall , I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a compact HD video camera for simple everyday shots .
p1672
aV-LRB- That look prfessional -RRB- : -RRB-

VI recently purchased this Flip Cam , but it showed up broken .
p1675
aVRunning through the usual steps of troubleshooting new equipment -LRB- charged battery , reset button , holding power button , etc. -RRB- yielded nothing .
p1676
aVI returned it and ordered a new one .
p1677
aVThe second one showed up and it was also broken !
p1678
aVNot happy !
p1679
aa(lp1680
VWhen it was working , it took great pictures and was very easy to use .
p1681
aVI purchased this camera just over and year ago and now it wo n't work .
p1682
aVOf course it has a 1 year warranty .
p1683
aVMy sister purchased her 's about the same time and it is not working .
p1684
aVChecking online and we are not alone in having problems with this camera , or other canon cameras .
p1685
aVBetween me and my sister we are two for two on failures with this model after about a year .
p1686
aa(lp1687
VI ventured to buy this cable to see if it works in my car .
p1688
aVI have a Fiat Palio Weekend 1.8 .
p1689
aVWell , the cable works perfectly , has a blue LED that indicates contact .
p1690
aVThe cable transmits data to my laptop without any problem .
p1691
aVI have the FiatECUScan software , which works perfectly with KWP protocol and with this KKL interface as well .
p1692
aVOne more thing , the shape of the connector is not exactly the same as the Fiat Palio , but can be connected with a little pressure .
p1693
aVYou 'll see blue LED lights .
p1694
aa(lp1695
VHood does not fit .
p1696
aVI should have bought the original Canon Hood .
p1697
aVIt would cost me more to send it back than I paid for it .
p1698
aa(lp1699
VLove it !
p1700
aVIt 's perfect for carrying in my purse as it takes little room and it is there for those `` Kodak Moments '' when I need it .
p1701
aVLove my Kodak Z981 even more , but it 's large enough that I have to carry it separately - and do just that when I know I 'm going to be taking pictures .
p1702
aa(lp1703
VI love this camera .
p1704
aVIt is easy to use , the photo quality is outstanding , and the telephoto lens is a Blessing for taking shots of wild animals .
p1705
aVI bought this camera 2 months ago and have never been disappointed .
p1706
aVI 've also owned a canon rebel g , and a samsung 4000 SLR .
p1707
aVBut this camera is the best !
p1708
aa(lp1709
VYes , it 's a junky little camera , one notch above a disposable .
p1710
aVAnd , without a flash , even 400 ISO film does n't do well indoors .
p1711
aVSo you really need to do just outdoor photography .
p1712
aVBUT ... this is one of the coolest toys I 've bought in awhile !

p1732
aa(lp1733
VI am amazed at the number of negative reviews here that come from people that , incredibly , thought they were buying a `` serious '' camera .
p1734
aVPeople , look at it .
p1735
aVRead the specs .
p1736
aVGo to the nearest store and hold it in your hands .
p1737
aVThis is a toy , meant to be bought for its looks .
p1738
aVIt is the cutest thing ever , it will make you the center of attention at any party .
p1739
aVAnd , to top it all , it can even take pictures !
p1740
aVBut if you expect the quality of the pictures to be the same as from a similarly priced Canon ... seriously , you need to have your head examined .
p1741
aa(lp1742
VI wanted a camera with a huge , non-telescoping optical zoom , excellent macro range , and the ability to take photos in low light .
p1743
aVI work in dusty , sandy environments a lot , so I decided against an SLR -- the Nikon I was replacing broke down because of excessive grit in the zoom mechanism despite daily cleaning , so I hate to think what would happen to a mirror-flipping mechanism .
p1744
aVI read the reviews for this camera , here and elsewhere , and debated the Panasonic equivalent , but decided on the Leica both on sentimental grounds -LRB- I learned photographyon my mom 's 1940s Leica -RRB- and the fact that Leica tweaked the settings , and they know more about photography than Panasonic .
p1745
aVI 've now had the camera for about seven months and I 've taken thousands and thousands of photographs .
p1746
aV-LRB- A lot of reviews seem to me to be based on the first 24 hours . -RRB-
p1747
aVI am very , very happy with it .
p1748
aVOutdoor photographs are wonderful , and the 16:9 ratio is great for landscapes .
p1749
aVBut that 's the easy part .
p1750
aVThe indoor photographs are great .
p1751
aV-LRB- Most of these have been taken in museums and churches . -RRB-
p1752
aVAt first I noticed a lot of noise in low light situations , but after playing around with the settings for a while , I do n't seem to get it any more .
p1753
aVMost important : Be sure to use Mode 2 Stabilization .
p1754
aVMode 1 only stabilizes a little , all the time ; Mode 2 stabilizes only when the shutter is pressed .
p1755
aVUsing the self-timer also helps .
p1756
aVIn a pinch , you can use exposure compensation to take an underexposed photograph and then push it using Photoshop .
p1757
aVI like many things about this camera .
p1758
aVThe exposure compensation works beautifully , once you get the hang of it .
p1759
aVIt 's also fairly easy to switch formats -LRB- 16:9 , 3:2 , 4:3 -RRB- .
p1760
aVI 've set up my own preferred profiles for various conditions , which makes it easy to switch a lot of settings at once -LRB- a church\u005c/museum setting without beeps , so people do n't glare at me -RRB- .
p1761
aVThe viewfinder grid has saved me hours of straightening shots with Photoshop .
p1762
aVAnd the manual is compact , well organized , indexed , and clear ; it fits in my camera case .
p1763
aVAnd the pictures I take with this camera just seem to glow .
p1764
aVThe disadvantages are quite managable .
p1765
aVI thought I 'd lose the lens cap , but I have n't ; sticking it in my pocket means it does n't accidentally get in my shots .
p1766
aVIt 's sometimes hard to get the auto-focus to work at a high zoom , particularly in dim light , which can be quite frustrating .
p1767
aVBut with resolution like this , you can afford to back off a little .
p1768
aVAnd it is big and heavy , but that will make me strong .
p1769
aVOne always has a vested interest in liking a camera that one has paid a lot of money for , but I find I do n't even window shop for the newest cameras any more .
p1770
aVI expect to use this one for another three or four years , at least .
p1771

VI am a long time owner of Canon SLRs , but I have to admit that I am not impressed with their Powershot `` A '' line .
p1773
aVI have had a number of models , three of which I had lens cover problems with -LRB- they do not fully open -RRB- .
p1774
aVI 've ruined a lot of pictures with this problem .
p1775
aVCanon could seem not to care less .
p1776
aVI also find that I hate having to flip a switch to go into review mode , as the lens retracts .
p1777
aVThat 's completely lame .
p1778
aVI have also found the menus to be non-intuitive , especially around picture management -LRB- delete , etc -RRB- .
p1779
aVAll in all , despite the raves about picture quality , I think this is an inferior product from a human factors and build quality standpoint .
p1780
aVI would not recommend it , nor will I buy another Canon A series camera .
p1781
aa(lp1782
VThe low-light capabilities of this camera are the big surprise in this camera .
p1783
aVIt actually sees better in the dark than I do .
p1784
aVI got it for $ 159 and feel like I stole it .
p1785
aVPanorama is simple and amazing , sharp  colorful pictures .
p1786
aVOnly downside ... battery only lasts about 80 minutes , but generics are cheap .
p1787
aVDefinitely worth the investment !

VIt was a pretty good camera until it stopped working .
p1790
aVOne day I turned it on and it started beeping and flasshing an eject tape message .
p1791
aVBut you could n't eject the tape and the camera would not respond to anything .
p1792
aVI had the camera just over two years when this happened .
p1793
aVLuckily I purchased an extended warranty at Best Buy .
p1794
aVBest Buy sent the camera to Canon for repair .
p1795
aVCanon would not repair it because it would be too expensive so , Best Buy gave me a new camera .
p1796
aVAnd I was allowed to get a different brand , so I went with a Sony Handycam .
p1797
aa(lp1798
VI assume that anyone spending $ 10-20K for an M9 system -LRB- camera and a few lenses -RRB- will do their own homework , so I wo n't insult anyone with comments about the quality of this camera or the pictures it takes .
p1799
aVAll I 'll say is that in the right hands it is capable of producing stunning images .
p1800
aVBut at the same time , it is n't for everyone .
p1801
aVI have pretty much the full Nikon pro suite , but it 's not about one brand being better than the other - both take fine photographs .
p1802
aVThere are many things my D3 can do that the M9 ca n't , and vice-versa .
p1803
aVThe M9 is a different tool , useful for different situations .
p1804
aVWhether it 's the camera for you depends on whether you encounter those M9 `` sweet spot '' situations often enough to make it worthwhile .
p1805
aVThe M9 is best when you 're working in a slow and methodical way , carefully composing , adjusting every setting , leaving nothing to chance .
p1806
aVIf you 're the type of photographer who keeps his auto-focus lenses on `` manual '' most of the time , rarely letting the camera make important exposure decisions , then Leica might appeal to you .
p1807
aVYou probably also use your favorite prime lens more than any zoom .
p1808
aVFor me , the form factor is a big part of it .
p1809
aVThe M9 is n't all that much bigger than -LRB- say -RRB- one of the bigger point-and-shoots - but this is no point and shoot in terms of picture quality .
p1810
aVCarrying something around my neck that 's well under half the weight and bulk of a Nikon D3 with 24-70 lens , while not sacrificing an ounce of image quality , is important to me .
p1811
aVIf you 're on the fence , I 'd encourage you to rent one for several days to experience the Leica mystique firsthand .
p1812
aVYou 'll either fall in love , or you 'll be unimpressed and save yourself several thousand dollars .

VAccidentally broken my Canon SD880IS , I was looking for sth to substitute .
p1815
aVI though the SD1300 should be more developed than its ancestor .
p1816
aVYet I was proved wrong .
p1817
aVThe SD1300 qualifies for a mid-low level pocket cam : low price , light weight , wide angle and the pic is stabilized as described .
p1818
aVBut it is VERY inconvenient to use compared with SD880 .
p1819
aVThe available program modes are much less than SD880 : only portrait , night shot , kids  pets , indoor .
p1820
aVIn the old 880 there are tons of others like beach , snow , sunset , as well as stitch etc. .
p1821
aVThe knurled ring on SD880 is also handy for selecting the best mode when outdoor .
p1822
aVAll these are missing in SD1300 .
p1823
aVLeaving just the cost-saving  cheap-looking plastic concept that is not designed to draw appreciation .
p1824
aVIt also seems tricky to me that the size of the 12M pics are all of file size around 2M when uploaded on PC , while my old 10M SD880 pic has average file size 4M .
p1825
aVI would seriously consider buying something close to SD880 for double the price of SD1300 , but I really could not find anything within the SD family at this moment .
p1826
aa(lp1827
VI was really exited to get this item , when i tried it on my camera the bolt got separated from the ball piece and the bolt got stuck in my camera .
p1828
aVI would think the bolt was somehow welded to the ball piece but its not .
p1829
aVI found a way to carefully remove the bolt from my camera , then i happen to have thread locker from `` loctite '' and welded it then .
p1830
aVNow it works good .
p1831
aVThe same situation may happen to you so be careful , unless you have `` locktite ''
p1832
aa(lp1833
VIs this a joke ?
p1834
aVThe pictures have extremely exaggerated yellows .
p1835
aVMy ancient 5MP Kodak EasyShare CX7525 that I got for less than $ 100 takes MUCH better pictures .
p1836
aVWhat is the point of a camera when the colors are not even close to reality ?
p1837
aVLooking through the LCD viewfinder , everything is washed out with a yellow tint , and that 's how the pictures come out .
p1838
aVAll the fancy features are pointless if they are not actually taking pictures of what is there .
p1839
aVI 'm returning this garbage and the one I bought for my brother ; you could n't pay me to add its putrid photos to my collection .
p1840
aVI do n't think I 'll ever purchase another Sony camera .
p1841
aV-LRB- I 'm just an amateur taking occasional photos .
p1842
aVYou do n't need to be an expert or even use a camera much at all to see this problem .
p1843
aVAnyone without severe vision damage should be disgusted with this . -RRB-

VThe D30 is a great camera and takes outstanding photos .
p1846
aVI will put it up against my friend 's Nikon any day and his camera cost much more .
p1847
aVThe battery life on the D30 is amazing as I expected the same life as that on the Nikon .
p1848
aVInstead , the battery on the D30 just keeps shooting after the Nikon is dead .
p1849
aVThis is not to knock the Nikon as it is one of the premier cameras around and is a true professional camera , but the Canon will match it picture for picture for less money .
p1850
aVEither camera will make you a very happy photographer .
p1851
aVI regularly use a Canon EOS 35mm .
p1852
aVcamera so the transition to the digial is very easy as the controls are so similar .
p1853
aVThe fact that I can use my Canon image stabilized lenses makes it even better .
p1854
aVThe D30 does call for one of the EX flash units , so that will add to the cost ; however , the on-camera flash also works well .
p1855
aVPicture quality is outstanding .
p1856
aVI have had no problem with the software , but I generally download all pictures to my computer and do any adjusting , etc. with Photoshop .
p1857
aVHookup to the computer by way of USB is a snap and downloading is fast .
p1858
aa(lp1859
VShort and sweet .
p1860
aV.
p1861
aVSpend the extra money for the XTi .
p1862
aVI returned this camera and bought one .
p1863
aVThe XTi outshines this unit for about $ 100 more .
p1864
aa(lp1865
VI bought this camera after reading all the + reviews on several web sites .
p1866
aVThis is a very good camera for the price .
p1867
aVPro 's : price , simple to use , slips right into you shirt pocket or purse , very good pictures , bright LCD -LRB- sorry Kodak -RRB- , uses AA batteries , good video .

VProduct Overview : The Bloggie Touch Camera functions as both a video camera and a camera that captures still photos - in fact you can shoot video and take still pictures at the same time .
p1872
aVThe camera uses the MP4 format which allows you to upload the video or photos to sites such as Facebook , YouTube , and Flickr .
p1873
aVIt features a 3.0 '' LCD touch screen so you can easily search for your photos and videos .
p1874
aVIt has a built-in USB arm so you can connect the Bloggie directly to your computer to upload videos and photos .
p1875
aVThe Bloggie records up to four hours of HD video and has 8 GB of internal memory .
p1876
aVWhat I like about the Bloggie Touch Camera : The Bloggie Touch Camera is very easy to use .
p1877
aVI have the Flip Video Camera and the Bloggie Touch Camera is much easier to use , especially the record button .
p1878
aVI love the fact that you can use it as both a video and still camera - it is much easier to carry around just one camera .
p1879
aVThe pictures and videos come out nicely and quite clear .
p1880
aVBoth the video record button and still camera button are easy to use .
p1881
aVIt is easy to choose which video to upload and where you want to upload it .
p1882
aVIt is also easy to upload the videos to places like FaceBook and it takes very little time .
p1883
aVThe touch screen technology is a lot of fun .
p1884
aVHaving the USB arm attached to the camera is another plus as it is one less thing to carry around .
p1885
aVThe Bloggie Touch Camera is slim and fits easily into a pocketbook or even a pants pocket .
p1886
aVWhat I do n't like about the Bloggie Touch Camera : While it is nice having a built-in USB arm , the connection is very flimsy .
p1887
aVSo flimsy that I never could connect it to my computer without the camera falling off - I use the camera with my laptop .
p1888
aVThe button for recording is right above the USB arm and I accidentally hit it more than once and started recording while trying to connect the Bloggie to my lap top .
p1889
aVThere are a lot of icons on the Bloggie screen that can be a bit confusing .
p1890
aVThere is no flash option so unless you have the proper light the picture\u005c/videos can be dark .
p1891
aVBottom-line : The USB arm issues aside , the Bloggie Touch Camera is a nice video\u005c/still picture camera that is easy to use .
p1892
aa(lp1893
VThis is a great compact camera that is easy to take with you anywhere !
p1894
aVThe picture and video quality is great and easy to use .
p1895
aVI still have n't been able to import the video yet but have n't taken the time to do so yet !

VI purchased a Lumix DMC-LC33 seven years ago , it still works perfectly today .
p1899
aVI wanted to upgrade this year , and after giving the market a long look I decided on the LX5 .
p1900
aVIn every aspect it 's a Leica D-Lux 5 , but with a better grip , at half the price .
p1901
aVThe LX5 's low light response and image quality are incredible .
p1902
aVIt 's features are endless and rival many DSLR 's .
p1903
aVThe only drawbacks are it 's proprietary battery and lens cap .
p1904
aVThe battery I expect will come down in price and and I 've seen an aftermarket cap that opens in place .
p1905
aVI also wish they had come up with a better way to use a polarizer .
p1906
aVAll that said , this is a Five Star product and Amazon has the best price .
p1907

VWe have 2 houses on lakes in central Florida , and have had just about every kind of wildlife found in the Southeast , from alligators to foxes to bald eagles , wander into our yards .
p1909
aVI have several sets of cheaper binoculars , but wanted something a little better for general wildlife watching .
p1910
aVBased on the great reviews I found on the Internet I bought the Nikon 7430 Monarch .
p1911
aVThese binoculars are fantastic , far better than most others I 've used over the years .
p1912
aVImages are bright and crystal-clear .
p1913
aVAlthough some people in other reviews complained about the lens caps that came with these binoculars , I like them .
p1914
aVI can find absolutely nothing negative to say about the Nikon 7430 Monarch , and would strongly recommend them to anyone looking for a pair of high-quality , medium-priced binoculars .
p1915
aa(lp1916
Vgood luck with it so far , I also own an easy share by Kodak , it is far better .
p1917
aVI saved alot of money buying through amazon .

VThis embarassment of a camera is the worst mistake of my consumer-life .
p1921
aVIt was broken out of the box .
p1922
aVOk , that I can understand .
p1923
aV.
p1924
aVhappens to every manufacturer .
p1925
aVSo I took it to a so-called Samsung Certified Service Center who kept it for THREE MONTHS before giving me a new one .
p1926
aVThe new camera 's picture quality quickly deteriorated until the images became unwatchable .
p1927
aVSamsung 's customer service amounted to , `` You 're lying and it 's not my problem . ''
p1928
aVHorrible , awful camera .
p1929
aVStay away at all costs from any Samsung product .
p1930
aVIf you 've had luck with them in the past , pray you stay lucky because if something ever goes wrong they will burn you every chance they get .
p1931
aa(lp1932
VI love this camera .
p1933
aVIt 's tiny !
p1934
aVI wish all professional-level cameras were this small .
p1935
aVIt 's the perfect size !
p1936
aVAlmost half the size of a Nikon F5 , and probably 1\u005c/3 the weight !
p1937
aVYou can carry it for hours without feeling it at the end of the day .
p1938
aVThe problem with most cameras in this class and size is that their lenses are not sharp ; they do n't have good contrast , they have noticeable distortion , chromatic aberration and light falloff at the edges .
p1939
aVCameras -LRB- including this one -RRB- will have these lens flaws to some varying degrees , and some flaws are small enough that it 's acceptable .
p1940
aVThe Lumix DMC-FZ35 's image quality is excellent .
p1941
aVIt does not match a pro-level slr and lens , but it 's good enough that a professional with his or her abilities could use this camera -LRB- in a pinch -RRB- and turn in very usable photographs .
p1942
aVIn fact , if you 're good , do n't tell anybody you used this camera and let them guess if the photo was made with this camera or a nikon or canon dslr .
p1943
aVIt 'll be hard to tell !
p1944
aVThe FZ-35 comes with basic instruction booket , operating instruction on CD-ROM , Arcsoft Panoramamaker\u005c/Photofun Studio 4.0 \u005c/ Silkypix CD-ROM , neck strap , lens hood , lens hood mounting ring , lens cap , a very nice compact battery charger -LRB- no cord , hurrah ! -RRB-
p1945
aV, television cable hookup cords , USB2 cord , and one battery .
p1946
aVThe price is amazing , considering all of the features and accessories included !
p1947
aVAnd the battery consumption is the best I 've seen .
p1948
aVHandling ergonomics is perfect ... the size is perfect .
p1949
aVThe viewfinder is not too small , as some have said .
p1950
aVNumber of shots with a Sandisk Extreme III 4 GB SDHC class 6 card on 12 megapixels and highest-quality JPEG setting = 587 .
p1951
aVSo with a 2 GB card , you 'll get ~ 293 shots , depending on brand of card .
p1952
aVThe biggest capacity SD card you can use is only 2 GB .
p1953
aVIf you want to use an SD card bigger than 2 GB , then it has to be SDHC and class 6 .
p1954
aVDo n't skimp ... buy the best memory card you can afford .
p1955
aVThe size of the camera is 4.6 inches wide , by 3.1 inches tall , and 4.3 inches front-to-back .
p1956
aVHere 's a neat trick : You want more zoom ?
p1957
aVDial it down to 8 , or 5 , or 3 , or even 2 megapixels , and see how much more zoom you get !
p1958
aVThis is a very smart purchase , and I recommend it highly for all levels of use !
p1959

VFirst off , I am not a professional photographer , but more of an advanced novice .
p1974
aVLast year I bought a Canon SLR Xsi and thought it was the best thing ever .
p1975
aVThe pictures are awesome and I was very happy with it .
p1976
aVThe problem I ran into was its so darn big .
p1977
aVSo I left it at home most of the time and dragged along a cheap point and shoot just because I did not want to deal with the extra luggage associated with an SLR .
p1978
aVI started researching the high end point and shoot cameras as a compromise .
p1979
aVIt came down to the G12 and the Nikon P7000 .
p1980
aVI am somewhat of a Canon purist and ended up with the G12 .
p1981
aVMan am I happy with this camera .
p1982
aVIt does exactly what I expected .
p1983
aVThe build quality of this camera is great .
p1984
aVIt feels comfortable in my hand and does not at all feel cheep .
p1985
aVIt 's a bit on the large size as compared to a point and shoot , but it is much smaller than a SLR , so I am very happy about that .
p1986
aVThe overall picture quality is impressive .
p1987
aVIts actually a bit better than I expected .
p1988
aVI do not have the trained eye of a professional , but I would rate it close to what my Xsi was producing .
p1989
aVNot quite as good , but close .
p1990
aVThe ability to access most of the important functions via dials on the camera has opened up a whole new world for me .
p1991
aVNo more chasing down ISO and exposure in the menus .
p1992
aVThe camera has a front dial that is customizable also .
p1993
aVIt also has a TON of built in features that I wont review , but it is more than I have ever seen on a camera .
p1994
aVSeveral of the reviews of the video aspects of this camera did scare me , but it is a camera for gods sake and not a camcorder .
p1995
aVFrom what I can tell so far , the video is just fine , but limited .
p1996
aVAt the end of the day , this is a slight downgrade from my Xsi , but it is something that will definitively get a ton of use due to it being smaller than a SLR .
p1997
aVIf you are looking for a high quality point and shoot and do n't mind a bit of bulk , get this camera .
p1998
aVIf you need something to supplement a SLR setup , get this camera .
p1999

p2095
aVThe ZR45 I fell in love with because I was playing with the camera durring a planeturium show and it recorded it wonderfully .
p2096
aVWe were suprise to see that .
p2097
aVI wish I would have flim the whole thing .
p2098
aVnot less that five mintunes .
p2099
aVMy husband loves the color viewer as that is the only was he will flim .
p2100
aVI like the opion to use the LDC screen .
p2101
aVThe ZR65 is great it you have good lighting other wize for get it .
p2102
aVIt is a very quite motor to problem there .

VI bought this camcorder 2 years ago because my sony camcorder would n't work anymore .
p2105
aVNow it is doing exactly what that one did .
p2106
aVIt gives an ERROR and will not work anymore .
p2107
aVHope you purchase a warranty when you buy camcorders because i have not had much luck with any of them .
p2108
aVI did not purchase it from amazon .
p2109
aV.
p2110
aa(lp2111
VI bought this for the 4x4 trips I take just if I happen to drop it in a river by accident .
p2112
aVLet me say that this device is way better than I ever expected it to be .
p2113
aVThe video plays beautifully on a 54 '' HD Plasma display  the quality is amazing .
p2114
aVEven digital stills come out great .
p2115
aVI also used it in the pool underwater  it took great video including audio .
p2116
aVI give it 5 thumbs up !
p2117
aa(lp2118
VWhile on a recent birding trip , everyone was amazed at one person 's binoculars in particular .
p2119
aVI ordered these as a surprise for my husband , and we are both thrilled with them .
p2120
aVThey are so bright and sharp .
p2121
aVWe did n't know what we had been missing .
p2122
aVWould definitely recommend them to anyone , particularly birders .
p2123
aa(lp2124
VFirst of all , I 'm not a technical wizard so do n't expect a highly technical review .
p2125
aVI bought a Flip Mino HD for my wife 3 years ago because she loved to take movies but could n't figure out all the settings , etc. .
p2126
aVThe flip fit the bill quite well , but started developing problems with the off\u005c/on switch .
p2127
aVI wanted to be sure that we had a pocket recorder for some upcoming travels so after reading reviews on all the top selling video camera 's , we selected the Kodak Z18 .
p2128
aVThe Kodak was half the price of the original flip , but when you add the price of the data card and a spare battery it starts to get a little more expensive .
p2129
aVWe compared video taken with the Flip and immediately after with the Kodak set at 720P .
p2130
aVThe Flips picture was much better in lower light settings .
p2131
aVThe Kodak equalled the Flip 's quality when set at 1080P , but I understand at that setting we will use up the battery and memory space much quicker .
p2132
aVThe major difference between the Flip and Kodak so far is the lousy sound produced by the Kodak .
p2133
aVWhile I had read that sound was a problem , I did n't realize how bad a problem it was .
p2134
aVIn fact , had I known , we would not have purchased the Kodak .
p2135
aVI know you can hook up an external mike to the Kodak , but we bought this camera for simplicity 's sake , not to mess around with hooking up a mike each time we use it .
p2136
aVI took a guess at the battery life since our use will be at the 1080P setting .
p2137
aVIn summary , the Kodak Z18 is fairly simple to use , takes very good video at 1080P , image stabilization does n't add much , but we like the easy to use Zoom .
p2138
aVToo bad they did n't focus on sound quality whatsoever .
p2139
aa(lp2140
VThe product was easy to use and accurate .
p2141
aVIt is also a great buy !
p2142
aa(lp2143
VI brought this camera awhile back .
p2144
aVI have enjoyed this camera greatly .
p2145
aVPictures are great , red eye reduce , great flash , great zoom .
p2146
aVThe reason I 'm selling this camera is I just brought an digital camera needed to upgrade .
p2147
aVThis camera is great for those that do not like upgrade or just not into digital tech .
p2148
aVHopefully this will be the camera for you .
p2149
aVEnjoy your great camera .
p2150
aVbm
p2151
aa(lp2152
VI love this camera - that 's the bottom line for me .
p2153
aVI 'm taking a big step up from my first digital camera , the Nikon D40 which my husband wanted so he could start digital photography , and I could not be happier with my choice .
p2154
aVHowever , I think it would be a waste of money for any one not familiar with the adjustments we used to routinely make with 35mm SLR film cameras .
p2155
aVThe D7000 can certainly function as a fine point and shoot .
p2156
aVBut why spend almost twice as much on this over the lighter D3100 if you just want to point and shoot , and maybe edit with PhotoShop or some such ?
p2157
aVFor me , it 's worth the difference because I want the freedom to quickly and easily make adjustments such as setting aperature or shutter speed to freeze or blur action ; adjust the white balance on the fly for what I want the image to be ; adjust the autofocus field and metering to suit the particular situation ; switch from single shot to continuous , etc. .
p2158
aVThe D7000 puts all that in menus and sub-menus like the inexpensive Nikons , but it also puts it out right on the camera body , available through just one button and the turn of a wheel .
p2159
aVAlso , this ended up being just about as inexpensive for me as the D3100 because I would not have been satisfied with the kit lens on the D3100 - and replacing it would have been more expensive than using all the wonderful Nikon lenses I have left from the film days - WHICH NOW ALL WORK BEAUTIFULLY ON THE D7000 .
p2160
aV-LRB- Of course , I did get my D7000 for $ 1,199 , not the current prices . -RRB-
p2161
aVThe inexpensive Nikons keep down weight and cost by not including a focusing motor in the camera - you have to rely on one in the lens .
p2162
aVThe D7000 , like other top of the line Nikons , includes its own focus motor .
p2163
aVNice little bonus with the D7000 is its treatment of my old A1 lenses .
p2164
aVI have some optically very good , and very fast , A1s .
p2165
aVWith the D7000 , I can program it to recognize them - with just the push of a button and turn of the wheel again .
p2166
aVAll I had to do was assign a lens number to each of the lenses and provide the focal length and maximum aperture .
p2167
aVNow I can use them with no trouble , I just have to focus them as always .
p2168
aVAnd the switch to go from autofocus to manual focus on the old lenses , or an autofocus lens that ca n't effectively autofocus in the particular situation -LRB- like my autofocus trying to pick up a tiny hummingbird in the middle of a rose bush this morning -RRB- is conveniently located by the side of the lens where my left hand would be going any way to grab the focus ring for manual focus .
p2169
aVThis is one really sweet camera .
p2170
aVIt will do whatever you want .
p2171
aVThe controls are easy and simple to understand if you have the background in photography - or want to learn .
p2172
aVAs I said , I think people are wasting their money if they buy this just because it is the new , hot camera when it is really more than they need .
p2173
aVBut , if you want to be able to control the camera settings , and do it quickly without having to mess around with the camera , this is great .
p2174
aVNOTE , after reading other reviews .
p2175
aVNikon DSLRs have never had great video , and this does n't seem to be an exception - if you want a video camera , get something else .
p2176
aVAs for complaint about the manual , I think it goes back to my comments about needing to have some SLR experience or being willing to learn .
p2177
aVI found the manual completely understandable - it generally even explained each function a couple of times if you read all the way through the several hundred pages of manual .
p2178
aVBest way I 've ever found to deal with this is sit down with the manual and the camera and really work my way through every setting , button , and dial so I know what I have .
p2179
aa(lp2180
VInitially , the camera was OK .
p2181
aVPretty much average for a point and shoot .
p2182
aVAfter 10 months the memory card mechanism broke -LRB- the card would not stay pushed in -RRB- .
p2183
aVI sent it to Canon since it was still under warranty .
p2184
aVThey sent me a replacement camera -LRB- not sure whether it was new or refurbished -RRB- .
p2185
aVAfter 3 months the lens closing\u005c/opening mechanism broke .
p2186
aVInitially it would open but it would n't close .
p2187
aVAfter a while it would not open at all .
p2188
aVOf course , by now it 's not under warranty anymore .
p2189
aVI would definitely not buy it again .
p2190
aVIt lasted just over a year .
p2191
aVI had my Sony camera for over 10 years and it was great and never gave me any problems .
p2192
aVI 've also had a Sony video camera for over 10 years and it 's been performing really great .
p2193
aVI 'm going to stick with either Sony or Nikon cameras .
p2194
aa(lp2195
VGave this as a gift for my son who was going to Ecuador on holiday .
p2196
aVPerfect for recording events .
p2197
aVTotally easy to use and share .
p2198
aa(lp2199
VI bought this camera last summer when I was really wanting to upgrade to a DSLR and settled for an upgrade point and shoot .
p2200
aVI was really excited with the zoom , which is an awesome feature , and all of the other in camera options .
p2201
aVMy biggest problem with this camera is the poor image quality in low lighting .
p2202
aVThe picture will seem to be okay on the LCD but once it 's on the computer it 's grainy and most of the time slightly blurred .
p2203
aVAs long as I 'm outside , the shots turn out pretty good .
p2204
aVStill not as clear and bright as I 'd prefer , but not as bad as inside shooting .
p2205
aVAlso another annoyance is when you are in low lighting situations and you zoom in close , the camera wo n't allow you to take a picture .
p2206
aVI was recently at a concert taking photos from about 25 feet back and it kept just focusing and not snapping any shots -LRB- which would 've been great at the moment I wanted to capture them ! -RRB-
p2207
aVinstead I got the sides of heads or eyes half closed .
p2208
aVFrustrating !
p2209
aVA great feature with this camera is the options for sepia  black and white .
p2210
aVEspecially because you can change this setting while filming also .
p2211
aVAt the concert I attended the lighting was this awful red and I was able to switch to black and white and have a really good video .
p2212
aVIn all , if you take pictures outside in great lighting situations - you 'll love the options this camera has to offer !
p2213
aVIf you 're looking to take pictures indoors , at sporting or other events - I would definitely skip it because you 'll find yourself frustrated like I still am .
p2214
aa(lp2215
VWorked perfectly for 2 weeks .
p2216
aVAfter that , only disappointments .
p2217
aVVideo works only few days , at its only will , and when it works , the image blinks .
p2218
aVSound no longer works .
p2219
aVSeems to have serious issues with bad contacts .
p2220
aa(lp2221
VI loved the size of this camera when I received it ... I just tossed it in my purse and it 's ready whenever I catch my two-year-old doing something cute !
p2222
aVThe picture quality was fine for me .
p2223
aVI am slightly disappointed that it takes lithium batteries , but not enough to go to 4 stars .
p2224
aa(lp2225
VI take a lot of pictures and have been 3 other cameras in the last 2 years .
p2226
aVMy daughters have this and promised me I will like it and it will hold up for years .
p2227
aVLet 's hope so
p2228
aa(lp2229
VBought the 5700 as an upgrade to my 800 because I need the extra megapixels and love it .
p2230
aVHad to prove to my wife that the upgrade is justified , so I took several photos today with both cameras , and the 5700 won hands down , giving me much better enlargements and better color , too .
p2231
aV... Am now ordering accessories from Amazon , especially a 128M compact flash card , since Nikon only provides a pathetic 8M card ...
p2232
aa(lp2233
VThis camera take GREAT pictures in the automatic mode , but anytime I try to use the night setting or portrait setting , my pictures do n't turn out at all or they are blurred .
p2234
aVIt 's such a shame because the pictures in automatic mode are great .
p2235
aa(lp2236
VThis is the first Fuji camera I have used that I am disappointed in .
p2237
aVThe picture quality is not what I expected it to be .
p2238
aVThe camera is not user friendly .
p2239
aVThe flash is really poor .
p2240
aVI had to make a quick decision on which camera to buy and I wish I would have had more time to research other cameras -- Fuji or otherwise .
p2241
aa(lp2242
VNice camera for the price , Ive tried other mini cams this is the best one Ive seen , I tried it in all modes has a very bright clear video , Its not full 1080p but its still high defination , When you record with low light the video gets grainy , but all camera are like that anyway , it only has a digital zoom no optical .
p2243
aa(lp2244
VI just returned the D3000 because I did n't think it has as good or better picture quality as my older Canon G9 .
p2245
aVI have taken some amazing pictures with my G9 but the D3000 certainly did n't compare to it .
p2246
aVI was really shocked because I expected a big improvement .
p2247
aVI tried the 3000 on auto and some scene modes but the pictures did n't appear that sharp even though I braced it more than enough for a steady shot and a lot more than I need to with the G9 .
p2248
aVAll of the pictures on the D3000 were taken with the kit lens 18-55 so maybe it 's just not that good on scenic pictures .
p2249
aa(lp2250
Vi used this camera when my baby born , the clips have a great HD quality .
p2251
aVi wish it had a mic input .
p2252
aa(lp2253
VI have enjoyed my camcorder .
p2254
aVStill learning more about it .
p2255
aVI would highly recommend it .
p2256
aa(lp2257
VI got it to replace my 300D -LRB- the original Digital Rebel -RRB- .
p2258
aVAlthough it is smaller , with the Canon Battery Grip it fits my hands just ok .
p2259
aVThe pictures are amazing , I see the most improvement at higher ISOs .
p2260
aVI am not too crazy about the fact that they went to 10 MP , increased dynamic range or a fullframe sensor would have been nicer .
p2261
aVBut maybe next time .
p2262
aVOne change I am not crazy about is a green status light on top of the camera that shines when the unit is on -LRB- at least it 's not blue like so many LEDs today -RRB- .
p2263
aVI intend to put tape over it to cover it .
p2264
aVBut these are insignificant complaints .
p2265
aVThe camera is great , very fast operation -LRB- card writes , switch on time ... -RRB- , battery life is amazing .
p2266
aa(lp2267
VI suppose the `` little '' should be re-worded .
p2268
aVIt 's not the lightest , or smallest out there , by a long shot , but I really enjoy this camera .
p2269
aVSure , the floppy technology is going the way of the dodo , but it is still nice to have the convenience , to have it if you need it .
p2270
aVUSB is in use in almost all facets of life these days .
p2271
aVYou would have to have one extremely old and lacking P.C. to not have the USB port available .
p2272
aVBut , there are some out there .
p2273
aVThere are those times when the USB port wo n't read , when something is on the fritz , and you need that digital picture downloaded NOW .
p2274
aVI ca n't say I 'm a professional photographer , I do n't judge the quality of photos for a living , but I do enjoy taking pictures .
p2275
aVBetween the multiple focus , lighting , and picture settings , you are allotted many options to make the next shutter sound capture a beautiful picture .
p2276
aVI would have to say , professionally , you can find better .
p2277
aVCan find items with higher resolutions , with quicker data transfer rates , etc. .
p2278
aVBut , for me , the camera is wonderful .
p2279
aVDuring my time in the military I was deployed overseas , and the camera was by my side .
p2280
aVIf it can make it through 14 months in a desert , in the cargo pocket of a soldier , getting slammed around and whatnot , I 'm sure it 's a keeper .
p2281
aVOverall , 4 stars from me .
p2282
aa(lp2283
VI was very happy when my friend had finally bought me the photograph machine which I had been asking for more than 6 months .
p2284
aVI had really liked the shape \u005c zoom \u005c specifications of the machine .
p2285
aVBut was shocked to see my film rewinding just after the few films I had taken because of the easy reach of rewinding button .
p2286
aVAnyway I was happy to see my photos quickly .
p2287
aVBut it was another shock time for me when I finally saw my photos .
p2288
aVSome were not very clear \u005c some had different colors like white river instead of a blue one or a very pale yellow furniture instead of a bright one .
p2289
aVAnd faces of people were not very clear .
p2290
aa(lp2291
VI shoot weddings and other events .
p2292
aVI bought this camera as a backup to my DSLRs , but keep it handy in my glovebox .
p2293
aV-LRB- you never know when that elusive female model streaker will materialize ! -RRB-
p2294
aVI know other Pro photographers who own Canon 's G-series point and shoot cameras , and in comparison , the Nikon comes out ahead in many issues .
p2295
aVI shoot only RAW , and the write speed is very slow with those big files , a bit slower than the G-12 Canon .
p2296
aVFocusing is a bit quicker than the Canon , but still slower than a DSLR .
p2297
aVBut this is a point and shoot so that has to be taken into account .
p2298
aVThe LCD is larger and much clearer than any others in this class .
p2299
aVImages are very sharp when camera is handled with care , but probably not much different than the Canons .
p2300
aVIt 's less expensive than the Canon , so that could be another thing to look into .
p2301
aVI am not very interested in video , but the results blew me away .
p2302
aVFor someone just getting into digital photography , you may want to get a simpler , less expensive camera .
p2303
aVBut if you are a professional or an advanced amateur , go for it .

p2310
aVOur family recently went to Disneyland for vacation and the camera was perfect .
p2311
aVWe still have a lot to learn about all the features that this camera has .
p2312
aVIt is easy to use and the pictures turn out very well when I have them printed out .
p2313
aa(lp2314
VMy first -- and only -- camera was a Sony DSC W530 from 2006 .
p2315
aVI started shopping around for a camera that did what I wanted .
p2316
aVI wanted a camera that did the following things : a -RRB- was easy to use b -RRB- took good photos c -RRB- allowed me to learn about photography while still in my comfort zone I looked at getting a Nikon P500 and an entry-level DSLR but eventually this one , that I stumbled on by mistake , was the winner .
p2317
aVThis camera does everything I wanted and MORE .
p2318
aVI would even venture to say that it 's better than the Nikon D3100 that I looked at simply because it 's simple to use and can do a lot of things that the DSLR could not .
p2319
aVThe manual mode is very straight-forward and the controls are all very intuitive .
p2320
aVThe in-camera guide is the most useful thing that I 've ever experienced -- no sifting through the index to figure out how to do something !
p2321
aVThis camera takes excellent photos and has already gotten me interested in photography .
p2322
aVI love that the zoom on the lens functions as the manual focus when you choose to put it in that mode .
p2323
aVIt 's just a great camera all around and I recommend it for any budding photographer !
p2324
aa(lp2325
VHave n't had much of an opportunity to use it -LRB- new baby in the house -RRB- but what I have been able to do has been great .
p2326
aVI love the zoom and the wide screen .
p2327
aVIt 's easy to use and I love it 's size .
p2328
aVI just wish I had more time to play with it !
p2329
aa(lp2330
VI was impressed when I received the cam and I saw the size !
p2331
aVVery little , compared to my old JVC from 10 years ago .
p2332
aVThe quick start works great !
p2333
aVAnd it uses the cheaper cassets for videocams .
p2334
aVPeople shouls know that the USB connection is only for transfering the photos stored in the card -LRB- use the PC mode -RRB- .
p2335
aVAlso USB is for webcam purposes -LRB- use the tape recording mode -RRB- , or if you want to transfer the video only -LRB- not audio -RRB- to the computer -LRB- use the Tape playback mode -RRB- .
p2336
aVFor photos , with a 128MB card u r fine .
p2337
aVThe resolution is less than 1 MPix -LRB- 600X800 -RRB- .
p2338
aVIf you want to use the full video\u005c/audio transfer to ur computer , be sure u have a firmware connection -LRB- IEEE 1394 or I. Link -RRB- And about the software , u can use windows default or buy Pinacle or any other related , not necesary to wait a lot for the Panasonic one -LRB- if u request that appart -RRB- .
p2339
aVThis cam records great with good quality during the day , but needs a little light improvement for evenings and nights .
p2340
aVPanasonic should think better for next cams when placing the connection ports , those are kind of inacessible .
p2341
aVI like this one , I searched and compared a lot before purshasing this one , other ones have not the same conectivity or are expensive .
p2342
aVThis one works great -LRB- with good ilumination -RRB- , fast and with good quality .
p2343
aa(lp2344
VBought camera predicated on reviews ... S\u005c/W will not properly load , checked for updates on web site , still no joy .
p2345
aVSupport appears to be nonexistent , what good is the camera if I can not install S\u005c/W ????
p2346
aVMaybe I should return to Amazon and let them figure it out
p2347
aa(lp2348
VI loved the apperence of this camera !
p2349
aVI loved the slide down power on feature !
p2350
aVI loved the 5X zoomed !
p2351
aVSo I bought it !
p2352
aVI had this camera about 45 days when I got these wierd looking lines that looked like black tears in the screen .
p2353
aVIt was wierd .
p2354
aVThey were n't just black lines they were a little jagged .
p2355
aVSo , I returned the camera to the store I bought it from and evenly exchanged it for the same camera !
p2356
aVWell about only 30 days with this camera and the same stupid thing happened again .
p2357
aVI always kept the camera in a camera case , so I do n't know why the screen kept doing this .
p2358
aVAlong with the black lines , some of the pictures came out blury !
p2359
aVImage stabilization ... my foot ... when the image was stable and clear the photo would come out blury .
p2360
aVMore like reverse image stabilization .
p2361
aVI just returned the 2nd go at this camera to the store and returned it for a Sony .
p2362
aVI 'm bummed !
p2363
aa(lp2364
VWell , I 'm just amazed this model is still in production the way things are changing so quickly in the A\u005c/V world .
p2365
aVI bought mine two years ago and have recorded many hours of my children as they are growing up .
p2366
aVThis is a truly low maintenance and low cost solution for your video recording needs if you do n't have a lot of money to spend on a digital set-up .
p2367
aVJust buy and extra after market battery or two -LRB- and they 're cheap -RRB- and some inexpensive analog tape , and start recording away !
p2368
aVAfter you climb the learning curve , of course .
p2369
aVMy one problem with this camcorder is that the controls are anything but intuitive , and they 're splattered all over the unit .
p2370
aVBe sure to read the user manual carefully before you try to use this thing , but once you 've got it down you 'll find this a trusty and low cost companion for your family vacations and holidays .
p2371
aVOh yeah , almost forgot , the microphones are n't stereo but they 're really quite good for an entry level unit .
p2372
aa(lp2373
VAfter researching , purchasing and returning a Canon point  shoot camera -LRB- it only takes 10 minutes of video at a time -RRB- , I decided on the Sony mostly because of the 1080i HD video .
p2374
aVVideo quality is good but they only tell you in very fine print that in order to create DVD to run on normal DVD players you have to find and download some additional software .
p2375
aVAnd then I found out the software does n't work on 64 bit PC so spent 2 days looking for solutions .
p2376
aVFinally found a conversion program I could run to convert to run on my 64 bit machine .
p2377
aVPicture quality is marginal at best .
p2378
aVYou have to use anti-shake setting or you get blurred photos but if you use that setting you do n't get all the other auto adjustment features .
p2379
aVAnd who really cares about GPS functionality , Dog portait and baby skin mode .
p2380
aVIt is a shame in this day and age that you ca n't buy a camera that is simple to use , takes good picture all the time along with decent video
p2381
aa(lp2382
Vit is good camera for take pictur with 3d vidio and photo , the camera when arrived it was in exclent condition
p2383
aa(lp2384
VBought this for my husband ... we used it on vacation to take both videos  still shots .
p2385
aVI loved most being able to use it during snorkeling up to 10 ft ... I could n't find any other similar pocket camcorder that was waterproof .
p2386
aVThe pictures taken while the camera is at maximum zoom are not as crisp as one would like , but for the price and considering we are novices , I do n't think this camera can be beat .
p2387
aa(lp2388
VIf you are anything like me and love Black  White Photography , but do n't want to do a lot of processing , this camera is great .
p2389
aVThe larger screen and the `` film type '' options are the main differences between this and the 20D and for my money well worth it .
p2390
aVYou get beautiful black and white results that have much more dimension than usual with a digital camera .
p2391
aVI 've been shooting with it for a month or so now and really love everything about the camera .
p2392
aVI purchased it as a second body and an upgrade to my Rebel XT .
p2393
aVI could n't quite justify the money for the 20D , but with the added `` film style '' options on the 30D I felt I was getting another dimension that would justify the second body .
p2394
aVNow I can carry them both hiking with the dog , have a short lens on one and a long on the other and not have to risk my sensor with in field lens changes .
p2395
aVAside from the black and white being much better than any other I 've seen with a digital camera the `` landscape film '' setting , not the fully automatic picture setting , but the film one really makes the greens in your landscapes pop .
p2396
aVThe `` standard '' setting gives you beautiful , accurate color and great skin tones .
p2397
aVI have n't had a chance to play with the other two settings much .
p2398
aVThe camera is blindingly fast , I have to be careful to not fire off five or six shots the thing is so fast .
p2399
aVThe alternate 3 fps setting is a nice option to have if you have a slower lens and want to give it time to focus in a sports type situation .
p2400
aVThe only draw back I had was the size and weight of the 30D compared to my Rebel .
p2401
aVI however , am one of the few people I know or have read about that felt the Rebel was the perfect size for my hands .
p2402
aVMost people felt they had to add a battery grip onto the Rebel to have enough space to hold on to it .
p2403
aVThe 30D is much bigger and heavier and that takes some adjusting to , but I have been able to shoot great hand held stuff after just a little bit of aclimization .
p2404
aVThe battery life is also exceptional .
p2405
aVI am still shooting on the original charge of the battery after a month of use .
p2406
aVGoing back to the black and white , you can also add `` filters '' to the monochrome settings that save you the cost of getting a red , yellow , orange or green filter to further bring out depth in different situation .
p2407
aVI just love this camera .
p2408
aVI would rather take the picture I want in camera than go home and play with an exposure that is n't what I had in mind with software and I really feel that I can with this camera .
p2409
aVTotal die hard Canon fan and started out with a point and shoot Canon two years ago .
p2410
aVThe quality on that was amazing and with this camera your imagination is your only limitation .
p2411
aVI am also bad about reading instruction manuals and find that the menus are pretty intuitive and easy to use .
p2412
aVI know I am not utilizing all the potential of this baby and I am still taking amazing photographs !
p2413
aVThis camera is well worth the money for the serious amature .
p2414
aa(lp2415
VI 'm using the 400D -LRB- aka Rebel XTi in the US -RRB- since two days .
p2416
aVNot enough to give an impression on the quality of the pictures .
p2417
aVMany things have improved .
p2418
aVMost important the responsiveness of the camera .
p2419
aVI only want to give an advice about two things that to me are definitly much worse that the 300D I had before .
p2420
aVThe main one is the size of the grip , which is much smaller .
p2421
aVIf I use heavy lenses , 5 minutes are enough to start feeling my hand hurt .
p2422
aVHad I had the camera in my hands before buying , this reason would have been enough for me to go definitly for the 30D .
p2423
aVSecond one , less important : they have reduced the size of the battery .
p2424
aVNow battery lasts less , maybe because the cell capacity has decreased , or maybe because the display now has to stay on much longer than it used on the 300D .
p2425
aVI used my 300D battery charger also for my Canon MVX3i camcorder batteries .
p2426
aVNow I can not do that anymore .
p2427
aVThis was a little disappointing .
p2428
aVIn short , do not upgrade your 300D camera to this one without having held it in yur hands .
p2429
aa(lp2430
VI 've had the camera about 2 weeks and have been very pleased with it .
p2431
aVI was able to shoot 197 pictures and 7 videos with one set of batteries .
p2432
aVI have had good luck shooting underwater pictures of my grandkid at the pool .
p2433
aVThe only negatives I have are 1 -RRB- the flash is weak ; if the subject is more than 5 feet away you wo n't get a good shot .
p2434
aV2 -RRB- In powersave mode the LCD viewscreen is almost impossible to see in an outdoor setting .
p2435
aVOverall this is a GREAT little camera for the money .
p2436
aa(lp2437
VThis camera is without a doubt one of the best ones I 've owned .
p2438
aVI originally purchased it to replace my 4 year old Minolta Freedom Zoom 90EX that had been dropped .
p2439
aVI wanted another Minolta camera because I was impressed with the clarity and lighting of my old camera .
p2440
aVI bought the 150 version mainly for its compact size .
p2441
aVAfter snapping two rolls with it , I must say that it 's surpassed my already high expectations of Minolta cameras .
p2442
aVThe pictures came out very sharp and clear with brilliant colors .
p2443
aVThe suede case it came with was a very nice addition , as was the remote control and self timer .
p2444
aVI especially like the sleek silver look and small size .
p2445
aVI have n't had any problems with it yet , and would highly recommend it to anyone else .
p2446
aa(lp2447
VThis camera was by far the best camera option for the price .
p2448
aVThe only thing I could n't get working was the IPCMonitor software that came with it .
p2449
aVI even downloaded the same software from a different web site and even an older version , it wo n't even start just says `` failed to find system settings '' tried it on multiple machines and no go .
p2450
aVBut it does serve the purpose I bought it for and the web server offers all the features I was really looking for anyway .
p2451
aVGreat product , all my friends want one now .
p2452
aa(lp2453
VThis is an OK camera \u005c* if \u005c* you only use it for still images and not for video .
p2454
aVIt is worthless for video because the camera sounds -LRB- internal mechanics -RRB- are recorded on the audio , and they are very loud !
p2455
aVEven if you do not adjust the zoom while shooting , there is still a noise still overwhelms the audio .
p2456
aVIt must be the auto focus .
p2457
aVI realize that this is a camera first and a video recored second , but it is supposed to do both , and I need a camera that does both , therefore the one star rating .
p2458
aVI have returned the camera and purchased the href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QFZMCO/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/187-2033241-5981438"> Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3 inch LCD -LRB- Black -RRB-  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Update 3\u005c/28\u005c/10 The Panasonic DMC-ZS3 takes fantastic pictures , and the audio is not ruined with noise from it 's lens motor .
p2459
aVSome -LRB- audio -RRB- noise is recorded if the lens is adjusted -LRB- zoomed -RRB- while shooting video , but it is minor compared to the almost constant and loud noise from the Sony DSC-W370 .
p2460
aVMac users : I was able to import video recorded in AVCHD Lite directly into iMovie 09 without a problem .
p2461
aa(lp2462
VI started with Canon film SLR .
p2463
aVThe 7D was a replacement for my Rebel XSi .
p2464
aVI needed better indoor pictures without flash .
p2465
aVI like the higher and auto ISO , full and brighter view finder , easy to use Live View , and built in wireless flash control .
p2466
aVGiven all these features , I do n't mind the bigger body .
p2467
aVThe only other thing thing that I wanted is to use the wireless flash without firing the camera 's flash .
p2468
aa(lp2469
VJust got this camera a couple of days ago , so far have been very impressed .
p2470
aVI am a novice in every sense of the word and this camera makes it easy to at least take a nice looking picture .
p2471
aVRice feature set and a great zoom .
p2472
aVTook some early spring outdoor pictures today and am very pleased with the vibrant results !
p2473
aVOne complaint which i have seen in other reviews , lens cap is too big ?!
p2474
aVvery strange flaw but I can deal with it , especially since the thing is dirt cheap .
p2475
aVIf your not a person who needs a camera that takes magazine quality photos i think you will be very please with this purchase .
p2476
aa(lp2477
VI bought a Nikon Coolpix S3000 in November .
p2478
aVIt took nice pictures and was fairly easy to use , albeit extremely slow to open and close .
p2479
aVHowever , it is now March and my camera no longer works .
p2480
aVAT ALL .
p2481
aVThe lens stopped opening some of the time on my recent trip to El Salvador , and stopped opening for good a week later on a trip to an island in South Georgia .
p2482
aVI mentioned this problem online , and 5 of my friends have commented that their Coolpix cameras have done the same thing .
p2483
aVI have contacted Nikon , and while they have offered to fix the camera if I provide a proof of purchase , they will not replace or refund this clearly defective item .
p2484
aVThis is one of the worst purchases I have ever made in the electronics category .
p2485
aa(lp2486
VI LOVE THIS CAMCORDER !!!!!!!
p2487
aVI got it for Christmas from my dad so I could film an independant movie , and so far I 'm loving it !
p2488
aVIt has many features , most of which can be controlled manually ; a characteristic that is very important to me .
p2489
aVThis camcorder has three filming modes : Auto , Movie and Cinema ; of these modes Cinema is my overall favorite , although one can not take pictures in this mode .
p2490
aVCinema mode has different filters that can be applied , such as Sepia or Black and White , as well as 4-5 others .
p2491
aVI was very surprised at the tremendous quality of this camcorder !
p2492
aVOn the day I got it , I plugged it into my TV and filmed short videos with my sister , and the quality was almost movie like .
p2493
aVThis was only after tweaking and playing with the settings for a short while .
p2494
aVWith this camcorder , I also recieved a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006I51V/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-6414198-3116912"> Audio-Technica ATR-35S Lavalier Microphone  which works very well !
p2495
aVI strongly reccomend this product if you are an amateur videographer , because it is very easy to use for me , and I 'm only 13 .
p2496
aVThis is one of the best prosumer camcorders , and I look foreward to using it for my movie !!
p2497
aVIf you want to see some test footage that I made about a week ago using just myself and the remote control that comes with the camcorder , here 's the link for my youtube video -LRB- just copy and paste to your web adress bar -RRB- : -LRB- .
p2498
aV. -RRB-
p2499
aVHope this helped !!!!!!
p2500
aa(lp2501
VGreat PRO 3CCD camera .
p2502
aVWe bought this camera because of it 's lens quality and zoom capabilities .
p2503
aa(lp2504
Vi did lots of researching , internet and stores , on most of the novice friendly slrs 's out there .
p2505
aVi really wanted the canon rebel xt because it 's the lightest one out there and pretty sharp looking .
p2506
aVwhen i was unwilling to pay the price i took a serious look at the olympus e300 .
p2507
aVit 's not as pretty as the rebel but there are still many reasons to love this camera !
p2508
aVi actually like that it looks like the cameras of yester-year !
p2509
aVkind of clunky but has all the great new digital features we 're all yearning for now .
p2510
aVi love that it can be completely manual , totally automatic and anywhere in between .
p2511
aVi love the fact that you can buy just the body , the body with one lens or the body with 2 lenses .
p2512
aVit 's always been a pain even with the 35mm 's that you have to get each component like the filters and flash but we should all be used to that by now !
p2513
aVi 've only owned the camera for a couple of weeks so i have n't yet explored all the possiblities but just tinkering with it i have taken some pretty good shots .
p2514
aVit 's a pretty cool camera .
p2515
aVps - batteries , flashes , oem cases can all be checked out at e-bay .
p2516
aVi got some pretty good deals on the accessories .
p2517
aa(lp2518
VI have been toying with the thought of going to a DSLR for some time .
p2519
aVI found this one just days before Christmas and after taking into careful consideration of the other reviews and the pictures posted I decided to order the camera .
p2520
aVIt made it in time for me to use it on Christmas morning .
p2521
aVThe battery charged quickly and the ease of use in the automatic setting is great .
p2522
aVI 'm looking forward to experimenting more .
p2523
aVHopefully , I wo n't annoy the family too much with the constant picture taking .
p2524
aa(lp2525
VThis is a good scope - not great .
p2526
aVWould not recommend .
p2527
aVThe focuser was sloppy , too much play .
p2528
aVDisassembled it , added more teflon shims , relubed it with silicon and tightened the gear .
p2529
aVThe tripod , despite it 's rugged looks is flimsy .
p2530
aVIf you have even a moderate breeze expect your image to be shaky and blurry .
p2531
aVThe finder scope is cheap , awkward and poorly mounted .
p2532
aVAs an aside - I bought a 70MM Mead refractor -LRB- $ 50 -RRB- .
p2533
aVIs easier to use , less bulky and gets just as good an image .
p2534
aVUPDATED COMMENTS : I have had this scope for about a year now .
p2535
aVStill not happy with it and will use my recent acquisition , a 40 + y\u005c/o Sears Stargazer Refractor , rather than set this thing up .
p2536
aVI have been to star parties where there are terrific Celestron Scopes being used - all Schmidt-Cassegrain - with superb images .
p2537
aVMy rating has not changed and my humble opinion is that this telescope is not worth the money .
p2538
aVI have had the mirror out , cleaned it , have a laser collimater , keep the scope protected in a padded case , yet despite my TLC can not even get a decent view of Saturn 's rings .
p2539
aVForget the details in the Orion Nebula !
p2540
aVIf all you are interested in is the moon .
p2541
aV.
p2542
aVenjoy .
p2543
aa(lp2544
Vcamera works well , has a large viewing screen , easy controls , takes very sharp pictures , color is very accurate .
p2545
aVOverall a very good choice for a digital camera .
p2546
aa(lp2547
VI ordered these to use at a broadway-style show and to use for my kids ' choir concerts .
p2548
aVThe chain makes them easy to get to and the light it just right for looking at the program .
p2549
aVI actually got the Titanium finish with gold rings .
p2550
aVThey look really classy - kind of like jewelry .
p2551
aa(lp2552
VI am a big fan of Canon products , Canon printer , Canon Powershot , and I am real happy with both .
p2553
aVWhen I first set my eyes on the Elura 50 , I fell in love .
p2554
aVA perfect companion to my Powershot !
p2555
aVI must say in opening the box , the 50 is well built and has a beatiful faux metallic finish .
p2556
aVThe size is nothing short of amazing .
p2557
aVBut then I had to ruin it by taking video !
p2558
aVI took my first test video in my kitchen during the day , which I would consider pretty well lit .
p2559
aVThe video was so grainy I could hardly bare to watch it .
p2560
aVI moved to other areas inside the house .
p2561
aV.
p2562
aVa family room with a patio door open and all the lights on ... still grainy .
p2563
aVI must say when I did move outside the video was great .
p2564
aVThe audio was also not too great ... the motor noise I thought was acceptable , but with the mic on top of the camcorder , it did n't pick up the audio from someone talking directly in front very well .
p2565
aVAny more than 5 feet away and you would need to turn the TV volume way up .
p2566
aVAlso the auto focus , though not too bad , did seem to `` wonder '' while finding its focus ... I ended up trading it in for a TRV-22 .
p2567
aVGreat video both inside and out , great sound and focus .
p2568
aVWhen Canon can make an Elura to match the video and sound quality of the 22 , I 'll buy it !
p2569
aa(lp2570
VDropped it in the ocean about 4 feet in the surf .
p2571
aV.
p2572
aVAlmost gave up but kept on looking  finely found it @ the bottom of the sand  it was perfectly fine still working ... I take it kayaking in the ocean works awesome .
p2573
aV.
p2574
aVGood quality videos .

VI am very pleased with the Cannon SD1300IS after using it over the Christmas vacation .
p2581
aVI took more than 30 pics and even had a few complete strangers take a few for us .
p2582
aVNone of them came out poorly and they all had vivid color and clarity .
p2583
aVFor $ 109 bucks , this is a real steal of a purchase .
p2584
aVAmazon even hooked me up with a credit after the price came down shortly after I purchased mine for ~ $ 21 more a few days prior .
p2585
aVBy this and you wo n't be disappointed in the least !
p2586
aa(lp2587
Vbought the camers from amazon it has features , features and more features buy rechargeables batt buy a 512 mb card no more complaints at this price would you expect canon to give u all this leave manual focus to the professionals get onto auto and shoot away the movie mode is fantastic sound is amazing the optical zoom is the longest in its class try it final rating 6 out of 5
p2588
aa(lp2589
VLuckily I did n't buy it .
p2590
aVMy soon-to-be 7 yr old daughter got this for x-mas from my sister-in-law .
p2591
aVMy daughter took a video indoors and it came out very grainy  dark but she did n't care .
p2592
aVshe was just happy to have her own video camera .
p2593
aVFrom what I can see Coby has another video camera -LRB- Coby cam 3000 -RRB- for only $ 10 .
p2594
aVmore that seems to has gotten better reviews -LRB- only 2 but they are positive -RRB- .
p2595
aVI would say , pay the extra $ 10 .
p2596
aVif you can .
p2597
aVI 'm sure the quality of the video will look a little better when used outdoors .
p2598
aVIf I had paid for it , I would not have been happy at all .
p2599
aa(lp2600
VPicked one of these up the other day , mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller .
p2601
aVBut that 's all it has , is looks ... After using the keyboard , it quickly became tedious to use , since not only are the keys hard to push down , they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places , and the wireless is hit and miss , possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency .
p2602
aVIt will miss keys here and there , so you have to type very slooow , and check your work very often , and with passwords where you ca n't see what you are typing , good luck !
p2603
aVIt quickly becomes a tire ... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature ... The processor is 2 `` generations '' older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2 ... Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard , this is a terrible value and a POS .
p2604
aa(lp2605
VThis is a great camera .
p2606
aVEasy to use and easy to play back on HDTV .
p2607
aVI rated the software 5 stars , but I 'm not sure what software I 'm rating .
p2608
aVIf it is the software that operates the camera , then 5 stars is accurate .
p2609
aVI did n't load any other software and I have n't bothered to load the FlipShare software , so I 'm not commenting on that .
p2610
aVThe videos play back just fine using Quicktime .
p2611
aVBe careful about HDMI cables .
p2612
aVThis camera requires the micro connector on one end , not the mini connector , so the HDMI cables that I ordered online were not correct .
p2613
aVI found the right cable at Best Buy .
p2614
aVThe pouch that comes with the camera is too small to be useful .
p2615
aVIf you connect the hand strap that comes with the camera to the camera , it all wo n't really fit in the pouch .
p2616
aVThat 's a minor issue , though .
p2617
aVThe camera itself is great and I expect to get a lot of use out of it .
p2618
aVYou can just slip it into your pocket and go .
p2619
aVI bought the optional AC recharger .
p2620
aVIt recharges the camera in 2-3 hours .
p2621
aVI recommend getting it , too .
p2622
aa(lp2623
VThe saleman at BestBuy assured me that the camera was compatible with iMovie software on our Mac computer , but my experience , and what I have read since on the web tells me that is simply not true .
p2624
aVI will probably return the camera .
p2625
aVBummer .
p2626
aa(lp2627
VI bought this camera for me and my wife .
p2628
aVWe had just had our first child and we wanted to use it to capture those little moments that sometimes get by you and there 's no camera around .
p2629
aVLet me tell you it is perfect for not only that but for any other ocassion .
p2630
aVWe recently took it to the beach with us and it was great for that also .
p2631
aVVideo quality and sound is great for such a small package .
p2632
aVThe things I did ` nt like .
p2633
aV-LRB- there were not many . -RRB-
p2634
aVThe screen on the back gets fingerprints on it all the time , but they do wipe off easily .
p2635
aVThe screen is kinda hard to see in really bright sunlight as with any other I guess .
p2636
aVI think it should come with an ac adapter for the price .
p2637
aVIf I could go back I would definitely buy this camera again .
p2638
aVIt is just so handy to have around .
p2639
aa(lp2640
VTook this out with my girls for an afternoon at the park yesterday .
p2641
aVThe ability to carry this in your pocket so easily is soooooo awesome .
p2642
aVThe quality I 'm seeing so far has been great .
p2643
aVHave n't read the manual yet , and have n't come close to denting what this camera seems able to do .
p2644
aVIt wo n't replace my DSLR , nor did I intend for it to , but having caught the photo bug , this is an awesome tool to be able to carry with you wherever you are so you wo n't be caught saying , `` man I wish I had my camera with me '' .
p2645
aVThis camera is not for those who want an all in one .
p2646

aVThere are cheaper cameras that can take nice shots .

aVIf you want the ability to shoot RAW though , and really enjoy still photography , and never want to be caught without your camera ... buy this .

p2652
aVSince it 's arrival , I have been extremely impressed with the the build quality , image quality and flexibility in control of the image making process .
p2653
aVIn fact the camera is extremely complex and does require a steep learning curve to master .
p2654
aVThe camera can still be set up as a `` point and shoot '' for family snapshots but allows many creative image controls for the professional in all of us .
p2655
aVJust a great camera !!

aV... The Super Cat eye is really super .
p2690
aVI can shoot picture in complete darkness .
p2691
aVThe Gamma is also wonderful for low light condition .
p2692
aVRemote control works well .
p2693
aVThe bundled image transfer and video capture software works beautifully on Windows XP !
p2694
aVI printed images as 3.5 '' picture on a color printer and it looks not bad -LRB- does n't help to print full 8.5 x11 size due to 640x480 res . -RRB-

aVI 'm rushing out now to get some mini dv tapes and a Windows XP for another PC .
p2698
aa(lp2699
VI have now done as thorough review of the image quality as I can .
p2700
aVUsing a tripod , with the subject about 8 ft away , a poster of Chinese characters , I took three shots on a timer at 4:3 aspect ratio , about 20-24mm focal length , using the D-LUX 5 , an older Lumix DMC-FX33 , and a Canon 550D with an EF-S 18-200mm lens .
p2701
aVThen I looked at the images zooming in to the max .
p2702
aVThe Canon was by far the best , followed by the little FX-33 , with the Leica trailing behind , not very crisp at all .
p2703
aV------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 19 July 2011 : Final update .
p2704
aVI think there is nothing wrong with the camera .
p2705
aVLike other things , you just have to know its limitations .
p2706
aVIt is unreasonable to expect it to perform as well as a Canon DSLR .
p2707
aVIn retrospect I had unrealistic and amateurish expectations .
p2708
aVWith the various test shots in the previous update , I have now looked at them with both Lightroom 3 and Paintshop X3 , both RAW and JPEG -LRB- FX33 JPG only -RRB- .
p2709
aVWhen I zoom in on each of the pictures , I get basically the same results as I did when looking at them via the on-camera LCD .
p2710
aVBut when I print A4 or even A3 size copies of shots I took along the Singapore River , the results are very satisfying .
p2711
aVI 'll keep it and would recommend it to others .
p2712
aVA bit pricey , but you get Lightroom .
p2713
aVI am still surprised that the Lumix DMC-FX33 compared so well to the D-LUX 5 .
p2714
aV------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 20 August 2011 : After using it now for two trips to the USA and back here in Singapore , I must say that this camera is great and exactly what I was hoping for .
p2715
aVThe color rendition seems very good to my eye , the clarity of the image is very pleasing , it does a great job of sorting out that difficult balance of the sky and the earthly objects .
p2716
aVI am a bit embarrassed for my earlier weak assessment .
p2717
aa(lp2718
VI like the design .
p2719
aVBut here is the problem : The product feature says `` FOUR HALVES '' .
p2720
aVThe picture also show 4 halves -LRB- for 16 batteries -RRB- .
p2721
aVWhat I got was only 2 halves -LRB- for 8 batteries -RRB- .
p2722
aVI am still waiting for Ace Photo Digital 's response .
p2723
aVUpdate 5\u005c/4\u005c/2011 : The company responded and sent me another `` Four Halves '' .
p2724
aa(lp2725
VFits well but the price is steep for a piece of black plastic !
p2726
aa(lp2727
VNice binoculars .
p2728
aVGreat quality , case , and deal .
p2729
aVSimilar binoculars are $ 200 .
p2730
aVGot it here for less than 1\u005c/2 .
p2731
aVOnce mounted on a tripod , you can easily view the moon , or wildlife .
p2732

VI had a hard time deciding on what SLR to purchase to replace an 8 year old Fuji I had before .
p2734
aVI LOVE this camera , my husband is a little jealous cause I ca n't put it down .
p2735
aVBut it 's fit every need I and all the settings I 've had to work in .
p2736
aVI feel like i 'm in a whole new world and it 's great
p2737
aa(lp2738
VI purchased this camcorder in early Januray 08 to document my chemotherapy treatment process -LRB- I guess I think my future kids will like to look back on when dad was bald -RRB- .
p2739
aVI had considered the dcr-sr82 but chose this model due to the higher video resolution , better still picture quality -LRB- and flash -RRB- , and higher quality audio .
p2740
aVI 've been very saisfied so far .
p2741
aVThe only complaint I have is that the low light quality is n't that fantastic , it is a little grainy .
p2742
aVBut even in my living room with just the lamps on it is n't that bad , and in normal lighting the picture is great .
p2743
aVBesides that it 's been mainly pros ... \u005c*\u005c* still pictures are 4.0 megapixels and actually look alright , a dedicated digital camera with 7 or more megapixels is better but it 's still pretty good .
p2744
aVThe stills taken while filming are just over 2 MP and do NOT look very good .
p2745
aV\u005c*\u005c* audio is recorded in dolby 5.1 and sounds great .
p2746
aVEvery sound really does come thru in 3D which really will add to my recorded memories .
p2747
aV\u005c*\u005c* The ease of use use great !
p2748
aVThe touchscreen is actually very easy to use .
p2749
aVViewing , deleting , reorganizing clips is done within seconds , and transfer to your PC is as easy as dragging files from one folder to another .
p2750
aV-LRB- however , make sure you have video converter software as everything is recorded in DVD ready mpeg-2 which are very large files .
p2751
aVIf you plan on sending email videos , uploading to youtube etc you 'll need to be able to convert to smaller files types . -RRB-
p2752
aV\u005c*\u005c* the size and weight .
p2753
aVIt weighs like two pounds and fits in my hand perfectly .
p2754
aVI see that some have criticized the way the battery sticks out , but I actually like it .
p2755
aVI think it balances the camera weight and provides a nice thumb rest .
p2756
aVI purchased an additional NPFH70 battery as the one that comes with the camera last about an hour when in use .
p2757
aVAll in all , great camcorder !
p2758
aVAnd at the price I see they have it listed for on Amazon.com -LRB- currently $ 619.00 -RRB- it is definately worth the money .
p2759

VI have a love of Polaroid camera 's and when I found this guy , I knew I had to give it a try .
p2761
aVI have always loved having my prints instantly and the Prints with the Polaroid 300 are sharp and clearer than any other Polaroid I have ever used !
p2762
aVI would definatly recommend this Product if you are looking for a good quality Polaroid Camera !

p2778
aVThe editing software works pretty well after you have had a little experience .
p2779
aVI still have not figured out how to use the smart back round music .
p2780
aVOver all a decent camera .
p2781
aa(lp2782
VI adore this camera !
p2783
aVIt 's perfect size and right in between a nicer large camera but the good parts of a compact .
p2784
aVI use lots of DSLR 's and i love them but there are times when i do n't want to deal with the size and complexity of them for things with my kids etc but using a small point and shoot takes terrible pictures .
p2785
aVThis is the perfect middle ground !
p2786
aa(lp2787
VAbsolutely amazing camera does everything you expect it too .
p2788
aVI think the only minor issue i have with it is that it has this image stabilizing mechanism .
p2789
aVWith a fish eye attached to it you can see the fish eye moving around on the screen very slightly due to this stabilizer .
p2790
aVAlso people like complain about the battery , seriously every camera has this battery life , buy a spare if you really go through it like that .
p2791
aa(lp2792
VTHis inexpensive digital camera is a good beginner camera and one that is so cheap that you can give to your 10-year-old kid to take to camp !
p2793
aVIt comes with software and it is easy to download photos to your camera .
p2794
aVThe photo quality is ok considering the price .
p2795
aVBut do n't expect to print these pix out foryou family albumn .

VI could n't wait to get this camera as I absolutely believe in the Kodak Easy share products .
p2800
aVI hesitantly purchased this one because of the battery requirements but thought that I had such good luck with the EASY Share cameras in the past - how could I go wrong !
p2801
aVI bought this for a trip that I was taking to Italy and also purchased a battery converter for over there .
p2802
aVThe camera is\u005c/was a complete disappointment .
p2803
aVThe first issue was when you first turn the camera on -LRB- insert new batteries or memory card -RRB- the camera is `` processing '' -LRB- which is clearly stated on the screen for what seems like 3 or 4 minutes - it takes a good deal of time for it to ready itself for action which was completely aggravating ! -RRB-
p2804
aVThe battery life was horrible -LRB- and still continues to be and I bought two extra sets of batteries -LRB- from Kodak -RRB- - these far outcry the double battery pack that was needed for my Z1015 . -RRB-
p2805
aVThere is a huge delay after taking a shot when the battery starts to wain and so taking repeated shots was virtually impossible at that point !
p2806
aVThe extended zoom was nice except when you really wanted it to zoom in , the shot would completely blurr so you had to back way off of it and then take the pic .
p2807
aVI bounced between all of the settings -LRB- landscape , flower , sunset , bright light , night landscape -RRB- and the others - but this camera just did n't cut it .
p2808
aVHaving the extra zoom capacity ruined this Easy Share camera - Kodak should have stuck with the trend they were on and kept the batteries the same - the 4 AA batteries needed just are n't cutting it and to recharge is\u005c/was a real inconvenience !
p2809
aVI wish I could say something better as I was really looking forward to the added zoom benefit - but this camera is not worth what I paid for it and I would caution anyone else that is considering purchasing this camera to look elsewhere ... in all honesty I am hoping that I just got a lemon !
p2810
aVI am now looking for a new camera because I just got back from my trip and found that I can not return it because it can only be returned within a month 's time frame and I have had the camera for 5 weeks !
p2811
aVLooks like this one will be going on craigslist or ebay .
p2812
aa(lp2813
Vits perfect for just putting it on the roof in between two room because wide range , really easy to use , it even comes with mobile phone software but for an iphone u can download an app
p2814
aa(lp2815
VIm not sure if Kodak quality control took the day off when my camera was made , but something went wrong .
p2816
aVFor starters , the sound is horrible , muffled , and , well , just bad .
p2817
aVThe picture quality is unacceptable .
p2818
aVIve seen 480p cameras take better looking vids .
p2819
aVOn top of that , the camera stopped working after two uses .
p2820
aVI have had many Kodak products over the years , and had positive experiences with ever one , except this one .
p2821
aVI would rate it zero stars if I could
p2822
aa(lp2823
VI struggled to decide between purchasing this camera and comparable Panasonic and Canon models .
p2824
aVIn the end so so glad I chose the Sony as I was looking for the best all-round camera to photograph family milestones and travelling\u005c/holiday snaps .
p2825
aVAlthough the competitors may have higher MPs and longer zooms - the low-light ability of this camera trumps all other features .
p2826
aVFinally in a compact camera I can take great indoor , dusk and evening photos when traveling .
p2827
aVAlso when kids are performing or receiving an award in a badly lit school hall , I can take a great photo from the audience .
p2828
aVThe HD video is great and avoids having to carry around a bulky case with camcorder and digital camera , plus moments lost switching between the two .
p2829
aVThere are so many awesome features on this camera with a wow factor .
p2830
aVTo make it perfect I would place the stereo mics in the center of the top or on the front face -LRB- rather than near where you place your left hand fingers -RRB- , a full touch screen instead of manual controls and ideally a liitle more rugged\u005c/protected features like the tx5 -LRB- at least splashproof etc -RRB- .
p2831
aa(lp2832
VNice features which are included because Canon saved money by using a cheap tape transport .
p2833
aVWithin very little time expect to be continually exposed to the `` Remove the Cassette '' which can , apparently , only temporarily fixed at the Canon Repair Center .
p2834
aVIt appears that the cheap transport is not model specific .

VIf any other company made this camera it would be a 5 star winner in all categories .
p2838
aVUnfortunately , it comes from Kodak .
p2839
aVWith a century of experience , the company clearly knows how to build a great product .
p2840
aVHowever , it still has n't learned about customer service , support or software .
p2841
aVThere is no editing software included .
p2842
aVYou can simply import the video in its proprietary format and send it to Facebook or two other social network sites .
p2843
aVSuppose you simply want to string together a few clips , add a title , delete a bad spot in the video and email it .
p2844
aVor that you need the competitor 's lip camera which comes with great software and customer support .
p2845
aVForget about it with Kodak .
p2846
aVThe thinking behind the Zi8 -LRB- who came up with THAT catchy name ??? -RRB-
p2847
aVbegins and ends with the hardware .
p2848
aVWith all the features built into the unit it outshines every other similar unit in the marketplace .
p2849
aVBut the team fumbled before they got to the goal line .
p2850
aVOne good firmware update and some decent editing software which includes easy email , and this is a complete winner .
p2851
aVAs it is currently , it 's an almost great video camera .
p2852
aa(lp2853
VJust got this camera and so far it is far better than expected .
p2854
aVI give 4 stars only because I have not yet tried the waterproof function .
p2855
aVThe video is incredibly sharp , great sound and has the option of taking stills while recording .
p2856
aVEasy to use touch screen -LRB- which can also be `` locked '' so you do n't accidentally change settings -RRB- .
p2857
aVCamera quickly starts up when you slide open the front cover , no need to press on button .
p2858
aVThe menus and many different scene selections are very simple to use and understand with a built in instruction manual in the menu as well .
p2859
aVI did put a cell phone screen protector on the touch screen to protect it from scratches etc. .
p2860
aVThis camera is also fantastic in low light conditions .
p2861
aVMy last camera was very poor in low light so this really stands out for me .
p2862
aVAs for waterproofing , there are rubber gaskets on the two covers that open .
p2863
aVThe buttons to open these are small and recessed so I do n't think they would accidentally be opened underwater unless they had not been closed tightly to begin with .
p2864
aVI used it yesterday in conditions below freezing and it performed well , battery life was good and the pictures turned out great .
p2865
aVGreat little camera -LRB- about the size of a credit card -RRB- !
p2866
aa(lp2867
VI bought this for using in paintball .
p2868
aVIt is small , light weight , the picture crisp -LRB- but not HD -RRB- , and easy to use .
p2869
aVI wish there was a way to get better sound without leaving the back wide-open .
p2870
aVAlso , it requires the use of Energizer Ultimate lithium AAA batteries , which are quite expensive for only 2 hours of use .
p2871
aVThe included mask mount is curved and when I attached it on the goggle strap it was not level , forcing me to glue spacers to get it to sit level .
p2872
aVThere should be a strip of industrial Velcro included -LRB- mine was missing -RRB- to attach to a helmet .
p2873
aVThis should work OK if you are attaching it to the top or side of a hard , smooth helmet .
p2874
aVIf you attach it to the side you need to make sure it is level at the point of attachment .

VI PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT BRAND NEW FROM AMAZON WITH THE LENS PACKAGE IT CAME WITH .
p2877
aVAFTER TAKING ONLY 68 SHOTS IT STOPPED WORKING .
p2878
aVI GOT AN F -- ERROR .
p2879
aVI REMOVED AND REPLACED THE LENS AND IT STILL DID NOT WORK PROPERLY .
p2880
aVTHEN I NOTICED THAT THE TOP BORDER WAS BLACK .
p2881
aVI HAVE HAD THE PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 2.5 MONTHS SO IT IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY .
p2882
aVI FOUND OUT THAT I HAD TO PAY $ 37 TO SEND IT INSURED BY UPS TO NIKON .
p2883
aVI WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED .
p2884
aVI WAS SOLD A BAD EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT FROM THE BEGINNING AND I STILL HAVE TO PAY TO SHIP IT BACK SO THAT THEY WOULD FIX IT .
p2885
aVI DECIDED TO TRY NIKON BECAUSE MINOLTA WENT OUT OF BUSINESS .
p2886
aVTHAT WAS A SAD LOSS FOR THE PHOTO WORLD .
p2887
aVI WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER NIKON AGAIN .
p2888
aa(lp2889
VThe reception of the monitor is SO CLEAN that I keep checking to see if it 's on .
p2890
aVI 'm so used to a buzz or some sound to let me know it 's on .
p2891
aVThis monitor does n't make a sound unless the kids do .
p2892
aVExcellent !
p2893
aa(lp2894
Vgreat camera , easy to use and i can use my old Cannon Rebel zoom and wide angle lenses with it .
p2895
aa(lp2896
VPurchased the Sony Bloggie 3D after comparing it online to the other cheaper 3D cameras , and I 'm happy with the camera purchase itself .
p2897
aVSo far it takes good video with good sound and the 3D that it captures is very good ; I 've already tried it on Youtube and it 's pretty cool to see my house in 3D video .
p2898
aVAs long as the Youtube video is switched to HD while viewing it looks awesome and Youtube even gives you some more editing and effect options you can use .
p2899
aVOn the 3D however : The big BUT is the lack of support for the video that the camera makes .
p2900
aVI bought this with the plan to edit the 3D videos I shoot for projects , and I do n't know if it 's gonna happen .
p2901
aVSo far the 3D video files created have not opened in any of the editing programs I 've tried , even after trying to convert them into other file types .
p2902
aVI 've tried scanning the files for Codecs and the program would not recognize them .
p2903
aVI guess this technology is still just too new to have many options .
p2904
aVIf you just want to upload and play around with some home videos in 3D , get this one .
p2905
aVSeems sturdy , great packaging , good picture , decent sound , and the 3D viewscreen on the camera worked surprisingly well .
p2906
aVIt you want to do more with the 3D video , you may want to wait or get frustrated like I 've been today .
p2907
aVHopefully there 's just some option I 'm missing somewhere .
p2908
aV.
p2909
aVor another couple hundred dollars in software I 'm sure .
p2910
aVUPDATE : After endless hours of searching , I came back full circle to , ironically , another SONY product .
p2911
aVSony 's Vegas Video 11 will edit these videos , but you are going to shell out close to another $ 100 to get it .
p2912
aVGee , I wonder why the cam did n't come with it 's own basic editing software ?
p2913
aVCashing in much , Sony ?
p2914
aVHowever , since I am a student , I was able to get an educational version a little cheaper .
p2915
aVIf you are a student , search for that .
p2916
aa(lp2917
VThis is my 3rd Flip camera , and I 've typically loved their product .
p2918
aVUnfortunately , this time I must join with the cacophony of reviewers to warn that the USB PLUG DOES NOT FIT !
p2919
aVI 've tried 5 different USB ports on 3 computers , and the Flip Mino HD -LRB- 2nd generation -RRB- will not connect .
p2920
aVAs such , it 's not possible to charge the camera or transfer videos .
p2921
aVComplete failure .
p2922
aa(lp2923
VGreat for posting family events on facebook .
p2924
aVEasy to operate and the visuals are awesome .
p2925
aVGlad our friends told us about this item .
p2926
aa(lp2927
Vfirst of all the battery and the charger were the wrong ones , so i didnt get to record my grandson 's graudation .
p2928
aVi was so disappointed about the video camara .
p2929
aVso right now it is in a box put away .
p2930
aVNo battery that fits .
p2931
aVNo charger either .
p2932
aVSo I rate this video camara a big ZERO
p2933
aa(lp2934
VI bought this just a little over 1 year -LRB- after the warrany expires -RRB- .
p2935
aVThen it started REMOVE CASSETTE ERROR and after that the cassette is useless , because anything I film on it comes out distorted .
p2936
aVSo what 's good about the greate features if it is no longer usable for just a year ?
p2937
aa(lp2938
VI bought this camera for the ` Blink Proof ' feature .
p2939
aVEvery time a picture is taken fo me I blimlk .
p2940
aVEven if they say the flash is off but really it is on , I will blink ... so surely this camera has the solution ?
p2941
aVNo. .
p2942
aVApparently the blink proof feature only works when the flash is disabled .
p2943
aVBut considering I do n't blink when the flash is disabled it 's a uselss feature .
p2944
aVOtherwise a good little camera , good quality images and easy to use but you will want to buy a memory card as without one the camera can only hold ten or so images .
p2945
aa(lp2946
V... I must say I really love this camera because of its great features and modest price .
p2947
aVInitially I gave this review 3 stars mainly because of the reliability issues -LRB- or maybe just my bad luck -RRB- but I should note that I am very impressed by the support I 've received from Kodak so I 've raised it to four stars .
p2948
aVInitially I noticed a tendency , once in a while , for the camera to freeze while you 've been videoing something for a long time .
p2949
aVI have noticed several other reviewers complaining of the same thing .
p2950
aVWhen that occurs , the only remedy is to remove the battery as even the on\u005c/off button fails to work .
p2951
aVThe file it was creating is , of course , toast , but you can mitigate this problem to some extent by taking shorter clips .
p2952
aVWhen running for a long time , particularly in the sun , it can get pretty hot and I suspect that might be at the root of that problem .
p2953
aVThe first couple of months I had it , I used it a many times to take videos of my grandchildren in the pool and at the beach .
p2954
aVThe camera caused a sensation , with a lot of people assuming I was swimming with my cell phone !
p2955
aVThe video quality does suffer from instability issues in those clips .
p2956
aVI find the electronic video stabilization does n't work very well and I usually just leave it off , but what do you expect for a camera of that price ?
p2957
aVIf you want to take nice stable videos , use a tripod !
p2958
aVIf you do and if you have reasonably good lighting you can take some really stunning full 1080p HD videos in or out of the water !
p2959
aVAfter a couple of months or pretty heavy use , the camera suddenly would not take a charge or make a logical USB connection to my computer .
p2960
aVI called , and Kodak agreed it was broken .
p2961
aVI sent it back to them and in a few weeks it was returned working like new , but with the original freeze problem still happening occasionally .
p2962
aVThe repair shop said they replaced all of the electronics and adjusted it to specs .
p2963
aVI was generally pleased with their work .
p2964
aVI continued to use it frequently , but did not use it under water until very recently -LRB- about two months after it was repaired -RRB- .
p2965
aVWhen I got home and charged the camera I noticed some condensation forming on the inside of the video display and on the lens .
p2966
aVI called , and Kodak agreed to take it back yet again .
p2967
aVBefore I sent it in I was able to dry it out in the sun with the doors open and decided to use it one more time last weekend before sending it back .
p2968
aVGuess what ?
p2969
aVThe original USB connection problem came back again !
p2970
aVThis time they told me they would replace the camera .
p2971
aVIt 's unfortunate the USB problem occurred again , but it is very good news that Kodak is really standing behind their product warranty which , I should note , is very generous one year with full parts and labor !
p2972
aVI just received what looks like a brand new camera .
p2973
aVI certainly hope Kodak gets the kinks out of it because it really is one of my favorite toys .
p2974
aa(lp2975
VFrom the factory , the K-r front focusing was really bad -LRB- tested 3 lens : 18-55mm f3.5-5 .6 , 28-90mm f3.5-5 .6 , and 35mm f2 .4 -RRB- .
p2976
aVI had to AF Fine Adjust to -10 .
p2977
aVI then found a nifty app called PK_Tether , which allows you to put Pentax cameras -LRB- K-x , K7 , K5 , K-r , K20D , K10D , K200 -RRB- into debug mode .
p2978
aVThat enables you to get to the Debug menu and do AF calibration .
p2979
aVI am not sure what the max is but I went as high as -19 .
p2980
aVYou would want to reset the AF Fine Adjustment to 0 before using the calibration .
p2981
aVThat way you can do fine adjustment from the calibrated setting .
p2982
aVOther than the front focusing issue , the K-r could use the individual AF fine adjustment setting for up to 20 lens feature available on the K7 and K5 .
p2983
aVOtherwise , the K-r is a great camera with the fix mentioned above .
p2984
aa(lp2985
VI do realize that the cost of this product is very low but the quality is even cheaper .
p2986
aVI would n't waste a dollar on this ` paper weight that lights up ' .
p2987
aVThe video quality is that of a bottom of the line webcam and even getting the product to work is something like pulling teeth .
p2988
aVWe bought 14 of these worthless cameras and every single one of them was riddled with problems and very poor quality video -LRB- I did n't just happen to get a bad apple -RRB- .
p2989
aVYou would think that a brand name such as Sony would have a little respect for themselves and actually pass their products through quality assurance but I guess even big boys such as sony do n't even care what they are putting out anymore .
p2990
aVI am litterally scared to buy another sony product no matter what it is , just on the remote chance that it would be even a fraction of the worthlessness of this camera .
p2991
aVI would list the pros and cons but that would be a lop sided listing because there is not one single pro !
p2992
aVBuyers beware !
p2993
aVYou would be better off buying a twenty five dollar webcam .
p2994
aVIt 's actually an insult that Sony would just pretty much screw their customers in such a way to produce such a lousy product .
p2995
aVI 'm even disapointed that I had to give it 1 star .
p2996
aVIf it were up to me , it would get negative 5 stars .
p2997
aVI feel it is my civic duty to warn people of the horrrible quality and craftmanship of the Sony DCR-HC21 MiniDV Handycam -LRB- and possibly the whole Sony Handycam product line , although I have never nor will I ever use another Sony Handycam product -RRB- .
p2998
aa(lp2999
VAs a professional still photographer just entering the digital camcorder field -LRB- I own a digital camera -RRB- , I viewed this camera with the same eye that I use to shoot publication quality photographs .
p3000
aVI really like it 's qualities - highly recommend it to my peers and serious amatuers .
p3001

p3002
aVThe ` image stabaliztion ' really works and the fact that it is a little larger than some digital camcorders is a plus .
p3003
aVSize and heft helps stabalize it in hand held situations .
p3004
aa(lp3005
VWe purchased this before my son was born .
p3006
aV6 months later it would not turn on .
p3007
aVWe replaced the batteries and nothing .
p3008
aVTech support gave us a few suggestions but it did not work so they told us it was shot .
p3009
aVI of course had not done a dump on the most recent videos of my son and now they are lost forever .
p3010
aVThey would not replace it because I could not find the receipt !
p3011
aVI asked if there were any options for me and they simply said `` No. '' Never purchasing Flips again !
p3012
aa(lp3013
VThere is still stock left , perhaps a year 's supply on the market , but after that - it 's GONE forever .
p3014
aVPolaroid stopped making the film months ago .
p3015
aVApparently , in rsponse to the fact that their patent expired , so Fuji is selling their Instax instant cameras , which are MUCH higher quality and better film resolution .
p3016
aVI guess Polaroid rightfully decided they could n't compete , so they threw in the towel .
p3017
aVThe fact they are still selling the cameras is dubious indeed .
p3018
aa(lp3019
VBest camera for the non professional photographer .
p3020
aVVery easy to use .
p3021
aVThe next step up is the SLR cameras .
p3022
aVMuch better photos then the nikon .
p3023
aVNot as yellow as nikon .
p3024
aa(lp3025
VThis camera has good battery life , and memory storage .
p3026
aVI did n't realize that I did NOT need to buy an SD card , as the camera does have some internal memory for videos .
p3027
aVThis camera has a great zoom feature , but I did not realize that even while zoomed all the way out , it does not have a very wide angle view up close .
p3028
aVI 'd say this camera would be great for sporting events , although I have not tried this outside yet .
p3029
aVThe camera is very light and easy to use , it does have a screw for a tripod for extended taping .
p3030
aVThis camera also has the usual video features that cameras have , B\u005c/W , Negative\u005c/Inverse colors , `` rustic\u005c/vintage '' .
p3031
aVThe full function remote is handy to have as well , as you can turn the display screen in almost any direction you want -LRB- including facing you -RRB- .
p3032
aVSo great for self filmed youtube videos , the only setback would be the narrow view as I mentioned earlier .
p3033
aa(lp3034
VThis item was easy to put batteries in and attach to the camera .
p3035
aVExcept , I have to use the cord .
p3036
aVThe item appears to be faulty and can not slide into the hot shoe .
p3037
aVIt works fine dangling and for taking pictures with the cord , but I was dissappointed .
p3038
aVThe antenna does need to be extended fully to get it to work more than a few inches away .
p3039
aVBut it does work fine and I loved the price .
p3040
aVI can push the button halfway to focus and that is very important to me .
p3041
aVEspecially taking pictures of wiggly little kids .
p3042
aVIt allows me to stand to the side and not hide behind a camera .
p3043
aVThis makes it much easier to get the children to look where I want them to .
p3044
aVSo , overall I would recommend it but with reservations .
p3045
aVNext time , I would spend the extra and get a Canon brand , but I did n't have the money and did n't want to wait .
p3046
aVI do expect I will have to replace this within the year , though .
p3047
aa(lp3048
VI really liked my camera that i got .
p3049
aVI like that it does manual and automatic .
p3050
aVmost do one or the other , this one does both .
p3051
aa(lp3052
VThis cam corder led screen did not show the colors and silver trim was off on switch , I reviewed this before .
p3053
aVvendors need to display defects when advertising a product .
p3054
aVI sent it back
p3055
aa(lp3056
VI sold my Panasonic DMC-FZ18 to a birder in India last spring , thinking that I would simply order one of the next generation of ultra-zooms .
p3057
aVThanks to Amazons 30 day return policy I tried the Fujifilm HS10 , Nikon P100 , Panasonic FZ100 and now the Canon SX30IS .
p3058
aVIts my first day ... but it looks like the Canon is a keeper -LRB- finally -RRB- .
p3059
aVFrom a birders perspective ... focusing was a constant struggle for the Nikon  Fuji ... they only took good pictures in ideal conditions ... and even then images were soft -LRB- blurry detail -RRB- .
p3060
aVThe Panasonic did a great job of staying in focus ... but is shots were too soft for my eye .
p3061
aVThis Canon is doing an amazing job of focusing , it ignored the foliage in the way  picked out a crow perched in a tree enjoying an apple , more than a 1000 feet distant at 35X .
p3062
aVMy 35X shot of a Golden crowned sparrow ... in mediocre light ... was really detailed and the 35X shot of a Black Phoebe in late afternoon light was tops as well .
p3063
aVThe image stabilization is excellent !
p3064
aV... and it feels so much lighter than the Fuji ... comparable with the Panasonic FZ100 .
p3065
aVTo be continued ...
p3066
aa(lp3067
VThis is a very easy to use , lightweight camera .
p3068
aVI wish I had bought one years ago .
p3069
aVThe pictures are very crisp and true to color .
p3070
aa(lp3071
VThis is my first Canon , which I bought after using different Kodaks for eight years .
p3072
aVBeing a newspaper reporter , I have training as a photographer , and I have even won two photography awards for my work in newspapers -LRB- even though I am primarily a writer -RRB- , so I 'm hardly a novice when it comes to cameras .
p3073
aVI take about 2,000 pictures per year that I add to my personal collection .
p3074
aVI decided it was time for me to evolve beyond Kodak and onto some of the better , more expensive brands -LRB- the sales reps strongly referred me to get either Canon or Nikon , which are supposedly the two best brands -RRB- .
p3075
aVMy Kodak had 8 MP and 12X zoom capacity .
p3076
aVI 've missed out on some great shots because 12X zoom capacity simply was n't enough .
p3077
aVI was attracted to this Canon camera specifically because of the 35X zoom capacity .
p3078
aVI never once questioned what the quality of the photos would be , given Canon 's reputation , and give the fact that this camera has more megapixels .
p3079
aVI saved up enough money for this camera and bought it just in time for the holidays ... .
p3080
aVUNFORTUNATELY , the pictures I took with this camera are no better quality-wise than the pictures I 've taken with my iPhone -LRB- which might have all of 4 MP -RRB- .
p3081
aVI seriously regret selling my Kodak -LRB- which produced rich , VIBRANT photos -RRB- in favor of this Canon .
p3082
aVI am honestly befuddled at how a $ 400 camera could end up producing photos that are inferior in quality to my $ 200 Kodak -LRB- and this is even AFTER I used my computer to enhance the photos -RRB- .
p3083
aVI think I 'm going to have to sell this camera in favor of something better , because these low-quality photos are simply unacceptable -LRB- and yes , I DID READ THE OWNER 'S MANUAL , especially the part about pressing the shutter button halfway at first -RRB- .
p3084
aVFOLLOW UP -LRB- 12-26-10 -RRB- : I have been reading the 196 page instruction manual -LRB- which is only available by uploading a CD into your computer .
p3085
aVThe paper version that comes in the box is extremely short and NOT nearly as detail-oriented , which was another mistake on Canon 's part -RRB- .
p3086
aVI see I have a long way to go toward learning how to work this thing .
p3087
aVI have noticed that if I keep the camera on Portrait mode AND standard single shot mode at the same time then I will produce the same high quality images I got out of my old Kodak .
p3088
aVUnfortunately , so far , the images in every other setting are still grainy .
p3089
aVI will update as warranted -LRB- any advice is most appreciated -RRB- .
p3090
aVFOLLOW UP -LRB- 12-27-10 -RRB- : I am learning more about this model -LRB- see the responses to this review -RRB- and suggest that anyone having problems spend the proper amount of time familiarizing themselves with the 200-page instruction manual -LRB- as opposed to the 30 page one -RRB- .
p3091
aVThis is a very complex camera , but one I believe will take quality pictures if the owner is willing to evolve beyond what is simple -LRB- that 's why I bought this camera in the first place -RRB- and have a better grasp of the mechanics of photography .
p3092
aVLowering the ISO to 80 or 100 , for instance , will make for a sharper image .
p3093

p3106
aVJust FYI , you have to have a firewire cable to transfer video to computer , get one online much cheaper .
p3107

VI have been taking film pictures with a professional Canon SLR for over a decade , and have been holding out on purchasing a DSLR until they come out with a sub - $ 2,000 full-frame body .
p3111
aVA few years ago , I bought a Canon digital Elph -LRB- S330 -RRB- just for some everyday digital point-n-shooting .
p3112
aVWhile the Elph has served me well , I find the lack of manual settings too limited for my taste .
p3113
aVIf I were to upgrade to a DSLR , I would get either the Canon 1Ds or the 5D -LRB- both of which carry full-frame sensors , a requirement for me -RRB- , but I 'm just not prepared to spend $ 2,500 for the 5D or 3x that for the 1Ds yet .
p3114
aVWith the recent addition of my family -LRB- a new baby -RRB- , I started to look into buying a replacement for the Elph so I can take more baby photos .
p3115
aVThe film SLR takes great pictures , but traveling with 3 lbs + of photo equipment is just not practical .
p3116
aVI needed something compact -LRB- not necessarily pocket sized -RRB- , but gives me the options to take pictures on manual settings like an SLR .
p3117
aVI did quite a bit of research , and determined the Canon S3 IS would be the best camera for my purpose .
p3118
aVI 've used it for the past month , and it 's been great !
p3119
aVIt 's shaped like an SLR , only smaller .
p3120
aVIt has most , if not all , of the manual settings of a full-size DSLR , minus the interchangeable lenses and an optical viewfinder .
p3121
aVObviously , with an EVF camera like the S3 IS you gain live preview capability , movie mode , and the absence of sensor dust issue .
p3122
aVThe live histogram is also a huge advantage over competitor models .
p3123
aVWith a long-zoom and image stabilization , the S3 IS is priced at a fraction of a DSLR .
p3124
aVWhile nobody should expect the same picture quality out of the S3 IS as a DSLR , especially at high ISO , this is truly a great camera for photo enthusiasts who are just not ready to buy a DSLR , or DSLR owners looking for a more compact digicam for traveling or everyday work .
p3125
aa(lp3126
VI bought this camera from Amazon just before we left for vacation to Florida , the Gulf Coast , and New Orleans .
p3127
aVI needed something small and light that would be easy to tote around , and this definitely fit the bill .
p3128
aVI did n't have enough time before we left for vacation to figure out all of the options and adjust to the learning curve , but I still managed to take some excellent pictures .
p3129
aVI had some trouble taking good , clear pictures at night though - I could n't get the flash to produce the clear images that I needed at times , but I think that is mainly due to my inexperience with the camera itself .
p3130
aVIt has some cool options -LRB- miniature effect , macro mode , fisheye lens -RRB- that I played around with and turned out several great pictures .
p3131
aVI 've posted a couple of these pictures on Amazon that I took with the Canon A2200 .
p3132
aVOverall , I 'm happy with it and would recommend this camera , especially to those who need a good camera that 's easy to use while on-the-go .

aVuser friendly camera , i like the AA power feature , not to many buttons on camera - it makes it user friendly , you only need to push the button after the initial NEW CAMERA SET UP , and all pics are excellent , oh , and is a SONY

VThe following camcorder is the first camcorder I have ever owned .
p3138
aVI purchase it because I am interested in taking home movies as keepsake .
p3139
aVFor that purpose , this digital camera will work perfect for anyone , However , if you keep your expectations too high , you will probably be disappointed .
p3140
aVMany people have complaned about motor noise on camera 's along this line , if you purchase the zr 800 , you can use an external mike of as high quality as possible , and avoid this background noise .
p3141
aVIf you are like me , and wanted the higher offered pixel ratio , then you can get the zr 850 , which lacks the external mike and the possibility of preventing that noise .
p3142
aVThe noise , I might add , appears to me little more than a suddle white noise in the background , which can easily be filtered out with most video editing software .
p3143
aVWhen recording to the sd card -LRB- the plus of the 850 -RRB- , the movies shot are rather low resolution and appear a bit blurry for me .
p3144
aVPart of this could be the videos I have shot this way consisted of a lot of close ups .
p3145
aVThis camera does not seem designed for doing much in the lines of close ups .
p3146
aVThe night vision does a very good job in pitch black .
p3147
aVA small led on the front of the camera adds extra light .
p3148
aVUnfortunately this is the only light you get , since any high powered light is n't available to attach to this camcoder .
p3149
aVThe led does n't add very much light , and with any low light area , the picture resolution is severly hindered , but still seeable considering how dark it is .
p3150
aVThe still pictures look decent , but obvious static that you would easily not see on any modern digital camera are very evident , so definately do n't purchase this as a digital camera replacement .
p3151
aVThe battery lasts about 45 minutes , the guide suggestions you can buy larger batteries that will increase the life .
p3152
aVSince I kept my expectations so high , I expected the resolution to be a little better on the camcorder in general .
p3153
aVIt is decent enough , and so is the sound .
p3154
aVI just expected more than I should have with a small handheld camera .
p3155
aVThe camera feels great though , it is easy to carry , easy to use .
p3156
aVYou run pretty much no risk of getting your fingers in the way of the view finder .
p3157
aVIt is very comfortable and easy to use .
p3158
aVVery little instruction is needed to figure out just about everything you can do with it .
p3159
aVMy biggest beef with this product , which really has nothing to do with the product itself , is that it did n't come with a firewire cable or capturing software .
p3160
aVThis means you ca n't transfer stuff to your compuer out of the box .
p3161
aVRather , you need to get a firewire cable -LRB- presuming you have a firewire port -RRB- for up to $ 35 as the price at best buy .
p3162
aVYou probably should order a cable with the camera .
p3163
aVThe capturing software is available from the canon website , just requiring you to register your product .
p3164
aVAfter trying several programs , roxio seemed to work the best for me trying to capture video .
p3165
aVAt that capturing video is a breeze , although that has more to do with software than the camcorder itself .
p3166
aVBesides that , its a good product , it comes with a remote control if you happen to be filming yourself , and av cables so you can put the image on the television .
p3167
aVNot the best on the market , but a pretty decent camcorder , especially at the discounted price .
p3168
aa(lp3169
VMy K-5 experience has been a real adventure : first I was sent a broken , used camera -LRB- palmed off as new -RRB- by an Amazon seller -LRB- Essex Technology Group -RRB- ; then Amazon sent me one that was either damaged or defective .
p3170
aVWhatever the reason , the images from this second camera were uniformly terrible -- muddy and ugly , with no definition .
p3171
aVAmazon was terrific : they sent me a replacement K-5 , which arrived today .
p3172
aVThe third time 's the charm !
p3173
aVWhat a difference !
p3174
aVThis camera is great , I am I very glad I got it .
p3175
aVI already have a K-r , so I have something to compare with .
p3176
aVI like the K-r very much , but the K-5 is a significant upgrade in all respects .
p3177
aVWhat 's good about the K-5 : -- 16 + MP -LRB- up from 12 + in the K-r -RRB- , increased DR , 14-bit color -LRB- up from 12-bit in the K-r -RRB- .
p3178
aV-- You can shoot remote -LRB- IR -RRB- from behind or from in front of the camera .
p3179
aVGreat improvement over K-r -LRB- you had to be beside or in front of the camera -RRB- .
p3180
aV-- You can shoot remote -LRB- IR -RRB- burst and remote timer .
p3181
aVAnother improvement over the K-r .
p3182
aV-- You can shoot with cable shutter release , which can be more convenient than IR in some situations .
p3183
aV-LRB- K-r is IR only . -RRB-
p3184
aV-- With the v1 .11 firmware upgrade , you can capture over two dozen RAW images in burst mode at 7fps before the shooting speed begins to slow down .
p3185
aVA huge improvement over the K-r , and one of the main reasons I upgraded to the K-5 .
p3186
aVVery few cameras at this level can do this .
p3187
aV-- You can set WB to Kelvin temperature numbers .
p3188
aVVery useful ; for me it 's easier than remembering a list of terms -LRB- `` shade '' `` fluorescent light '' etc. -RRB- which may or may not be entirely applicable .
p3189
aV-LRB- Althought these in-camera numbers do n't correspond to what Adobe thinks they are in PhotoShop , the differences are n't too great . -RRB-
p3190
aV-- At any given WB setting , the color seems to be a tiny bit better than K-r .
p3191
aVBut this is highly subjective and could be due to inevitable slight differences in environment , due to time required to remove lens from one camera and put in on the other .
p3192
aV-- Even in flat light , it appears to generate better images -LRB- more contrast and more detail -RRB- than the K-r , which was already a very good camera in any light .
p3193
aV-- The increased resolution is very noticeable in enlargements , which is going to mean better large prints and crops .
p3194
aV-- Even JPEG images are very good -- I just gave it a quick test for some images to view on the computer , so I have n't yet shot and looked at RAW .
p3195
aV\u005c* NOTE : for some reason , the camera comes with JPEG quality set to less than maximum .
p3196
aVWith all this firepower , I do n't know why Pentax assumes that the user wants to generate anything but the best possible images .
p3197
aVBut this is quickly changed through the Info Menu .
p3198
aV-- You can shoot DNG -LRB- Adobe 's version of RAW -RRB- which means instant compatiblity with Photoshop 's earlier versions .
p3199
aV-- You can make countless modifications to programs and settings , to customize everything in a way that works best for your shooting style and image preferences .
p3200
aVFor example , it feels more natural for me to have the front e-dial for aperture and the rear e-dial for shutter speed .
p3201
aVPentax has it set up the opposite , but it was a matter of moments to go into the menu and switch the dials ' function to suit my preference .
p3202
aV-- Redundancy : there is more than one way to access most key functions to change them .
p3203
aVIn many cases , you can go through a button , through Info , or through Menu .
p3204
aVThis makes it much quicker and easier to find what you are looking for .
p3205
aV-- User friendly !
p3206
aVMany settings can be accessed at the touch of a button .
p3207
aVThe choices are generally very good and take very little getting used to .
p3208
aV-- Like the K-r , other key settings can be accessed and changed by simply pressing the Info button once or twice , then changing from the matrix of a dozen items .
p3209
aVIn short , what 's not to like ?
p3210
aVThe price has come down , the kit lenses work great , the camera is compact and easy to use , IQ is terrific .
p3211
aVCa n't wait to take some surf shots with the zoom .
p3212
aV-LRB- Of course , some waves would help , and sunshine would be good , too . -RRB-
p3213
aVIn my original review I had some comments about the physical features of the K-5 ; they are very minor and with use I have gotten used to them , but they are real and I am including them here .
p3214
aV... ... ... ... From my original , `` First thoughts '' review : At this point I can only comment on the handling of the K-5 , since I have n't had a chance to use it much .
p3215
aVI have a K-r , which I like a lot .
p3216
aVI realize that anything new takes some getting used to , but I feel that the K-r was a little better in terms of handling .
p3217
aVExamples : 1 .
p3218
aVThe Mode dial -LRB- PASM -RRB- on the K-5 is a lot stiffer , and it 's awkward and unneccessary to have to push down the button atop the dial in order to make the dial turn .
p3219
aVLATER NOTE : I always shoot Manual mode , so at this point this is a very minor issue .
p3220
aV2 .
p3221
aVThe AF selector dial is also too stiff -- very hard to turn .
p3222
aV-LRB- Still irritating . -RRB-
p3223
aV3 .
p3224
aVI also find the battery cover opening mechanism to be needlessly complicated .
p3225
aVA simple push-to-open -LRB- like the memory card cover -RRB- or a simple latch -LRB- like the K-r -RRB- would be sufficient .
p3226
aV-LRB- Still seems like overkill , and it 's inconvenient . -RRB-
p3227
aV4 .
p3228
aVThe memory card slot is tight and the card sticks a bit , especially when trying to make it pop out for removal .
p3229
aV-LRB- I tried this with two different cards , including the one from my K-r , so it 's not the fault of the card . -RRB-
p3230
aV-LRB- The replacement camera is better on this score .
p3231
aVI 've seen complaints from a few other K-5 users , so this may vary camera-to-camera . -RRB-
p3232
aV5 .
p3233
aVThe flash cover will pop up when the button is pushed , even if the camera is turned off .
p3234
aVThis could cause problems when taking the camera in and out of a case ; if the cover pops up due to an accidental touch of the button , the cover could get snagged on something and be damaged .
p3235
aVThe K-r cover wo n't pop up unless the camera is on ; this seems like common sense .
p3236
aV-LRB- This still looks like a design flaw . -RRB-
p3237
aVNow , the reason why this review is so abbreviated .
p3238
aVI ordered my K-5 through Amazon , from Essex Technology Group .
p3239
aVI 've been burned before by Amazon sellers , so I contacted Essex in advance , to verify that this was indeed a brand-new camera .
p3240
aVI was assured via e-mail that it was a new camera .
p3241
aVBased on this , I ordered it .
p3242
aVThe camera arrived this A.M. I put the battery in the charger so that I could start using the K-5 as soon as possible .
p3243
aVWe all know the feeling -- like a kid on Christmas morning !
p3244
aVI could hardly wait !
p3245
aVWhile the battery charged , I got out the manual and the camera to familiarize myself with the differences .
p3246
aVI checked out a couple of controls , then when I went to put on a lens , I noticed that the lens release button -LRB- the one that allows you to remove the lens -RRB- was missing !
p3247
aVNot a good sign .
p3248
aVBy now , the batter was partially charged , so I took one photo so I could check the shutter count .
p3249
aVThis `` new '' camera had already taken 1,284 pictures !
p3250
aVI 've contacted Essex and demanded a free-of-all-charges return .
p3251
aVBut they obviously wo n't compensate me for wasted time and effort , nor for the frustration .
p3252
aVI would advise anyone to stay away from this dealer .
p3253
aa(lp3254
VI 've owned about 30 compact digital cameras and the S100 is , by all means , one of my favorites .
p3255
aVI 've owned and used it since mid-October , taking well over 2000 shots .
p3256
aVAfter taking time to learn how to make adjustments when using the 24mm\u005c/equiv lens , I have to ask myself how I ever lived without a lens with that wide angle .
p3257
aVI 've taken some of the best inside shots of my family , ever , with the camera .
p3258
aVI also like the longer focal length over my S90 , and the high ISO performance -LRB- assuming I get the settings right for a scene -RRB- .
p3259
aVIf you 're a full auto mode user , you may be disappointed with the S100 , especially if you do n't use center -LRB- single area -RRB- autofocus .
p3260
aVLearn to use P Mode and adjust settings -LRB- including Custom Color settings -RRB- as needed -LRB- eg .
p3261
aVwhite balance , ISO , Exposure Compensation , Image Stabilization , saturation , Focus Mode and focus point size , etc -RRB- .
p3262
aVIf you 're not willing to learn how to tweak some of these settings , save yourself some money and buy a less expensive , real Point and Shoot camera .
p3263
aVIf you do n't like to post-process images , this camera may not be for you either .
p3264
aVI take my s100 with me everywhere and it 's a worthy companion to my DSLR .
p3265
aVBottom line : if you 're a pro or photo enthusiast , the Canon s100 is worthy of your consideration .
p3266
aVIf you 're a die-hard point-and-shooter , look elsewhere .
p3267
aVps : I 'm not into video but I 've tried it on the s100 .
p3268
aVIt 's amazing though , for those who use a dedicated video cam , I 'm sure they 'll point out weaknesses .
p3269
aa(lp3270
VI bought my 7D in January of 2010 .
p3271
aVI 've used this camera for a quite a bit , both in still and video capacities .
p3272
aVI 'll review both separately to explain the pros and cons of each side of the camera .
p3273
aVStills : Pros : - Awesome ISO range and low noise - Great autofocus -LRB- really , really fast -RRB- - Frame rate is ridiculous -18 mp is wonderful .
p3274
aVGreat detail .
p3275
aV- Custom Picture Styles are extremely satisfying .
p3276
aVConsidering I 'm more of a video person than a photographer , I 've really come to appreciate the stills this camera produces .
p3277
aVThey are clear , even in horrible lighting conditions .
p3278
aVEven photos taken in ISO 3200 have very little noise .
p3279
aVI shoot in Manual mode , but when I need to get photos taken in a quick second , I find myself flipping it to Green Box mode and clicking on auto focus and firing off a few frames within a few seconds .
p3280
aVThe photos are awesome .
p3281
aVConsidering I photograph events , this has saved me a few times .
p3282
aVI bought the camera body only so I can use the extra money for a 3rd party lens , the Tamron 17-50 F\u005c/2 .8 .
p3283
aVIts a great lens , but the range is clearly designed for `` walking around '' which I do , but when I am a good distance away , the 50mm end of the range is usually not close enough , and not sharp enough .
p3284
aVI do have to say , for a semi-pro camera , the still side of the camera is the highlight .
p3285
aVThere are very little things to complain about .
p3286
aVIf you have the lenses you need , this camera will make those lenses create wonderful images .
p3287
aVNow for the cons : Video .
p3288
aVVideo : Pros : -1080 p resolution \u005c/ 720p at 60fps .
p3289
aV- Manual controls during shooting .
p3290
aV- Compact body and weather sealed Cons : - Rolling shutter Rolling shutter is when the camera takes a frame by `` rolling '' the scan lines of the CMOS sensor downwards instead of exposing the sensor all at once -LRB- called `` global exposure '' -RRB- .
p3291
aVThis is especially obvious in high action scenes and flashing lights .
p3292
aVShooting at 720 at 60fps , it is reduced , but it is still evident , especially in a moving car and looking at tall objects like trees and poles -LRB- they appear to lean -RRB- .
p3293
aVThis camera is best used in low action scenes with a stabilizer like a tripod or shoulder mount -LRB- which kind of defeats the purpose of having a portable camera -RRB- .
p3294
aV- Chroma sampling I understand that some of the readers wont know what this is .
p3295
aVBut for the film people who are considering buying this camera , this is for you .
p3296
aVThe sampling ratio is 4:2:0 .
p3297
aVWhich isnt prime for green screen .
p3298
aVBut another side effect is color grading is affected by this .
p3299
aVIt creates unsightly artifacts in the footage .
p3300
aVThere are tutorials online on how to upload custom picture styles to greatly increase the dynamic range of the camera -LRB- and custom Picture Styles to create amazing colors in the camera -RRB- , but there is one more thing that affects the footage : Noise .
p3301
aV- Noise Reduction The noise reduction in video is no where near as good as the picture side of the camera .
p3302
aVConsidering that some might not have the best light available , they 'll have to boost the ISO , and once it peaks past 1000iso , the noise becomes more evident .
p3303
aVCanon markets this camera as a monster in low light situations -LRB- which it is -RRB- , but the noise is very painful to see , especially when the footage is mixed with HVX-200 footage .
p3304
aVThe difference is obvious .
p3305
aVSo , since a good portion of buyers will not really care for the video , most of my cons are irrelevant .
p3306
aVIt 'll be a wonderful camera for the birthday clips and holidays .
p3307
aVBut for people who want to buy this -LRB- or the 5D -RRB- for film production -LRB- as I did -RRB- , the limitations should be considered .
p3308
aVIt is a good camera for dramatic films with little to no action .
p3309
aVBut , action is a difficult thing to capture on this camera without it looking gelatinous .
p3310
aVOverall , its a great camera .
p3311
aVActually , this is a wonderful camera .
p3312
aVIt is limited in the video side , but for a $ 1700 , it offers a relatively inexpensive high definition capability -LRB- most film quality HD camcorders are $ 3000 + and they have inadequate lenses -RRB- and a great `` equalizer '' for film students or indie film productions .
p3313
aVFor an example as to how the camera deals with concert areas , I have this video I made .
p3314
aVLook at the strange lines created in the flashing lights .
p3315
aVAlso , be warned , this camera will be destroyed if lasers hit the sensor -LRB- as shown is certain videos online -RRB- .
p3316
aV-LRB- ... -RRB- .
p3317
aa(lp3318
VI love this camera .
p3319
aVI purchased this one to replace my old old camera -LRB- only 2MB picture -RRB- .
p3320
aVThe results are amazing .
p3321
aVI 'm happy that I do n't need to use flash for low light settings .
p3322
aVThe auto mode is fantastic for people who just started to use this camera .
p3323
aVI 'm going to try more scene modes .
p3324
aVThe screen is wide , I like it .
p3325
aa(lp3326
VSome reviewers have complained of poor image quality with the F828 .
p3327
aVAnyone that is concerned can email me and I 'll send you image crops that compare an equivalent fraction of an image taken with the 8 MB F828 to the 5 MB F717 .
p3328
aVTo clarify , I 've cropped a portion of an image taken at the same place and time by both cameras in order to make the image small enough to send by email .
p3329
aVThe F828 file is ~ 8\u005c/5 the size of the F717 and therefore covers the same amount of the cropped image with respect to solid angle .
p3330
aVThis way , you can judge for yourself .
p3331
aVI already have and did before buying - not a bad idea when plunking down a grand .
p3332
aa(lp3333
VThe real dissapointment is the choppy frame rate .
p3334
aVAiptek advertizes 30 frames per second ... nuh uh !
p3335
aVAt first I thought maybe I did n't get a fast enough video card but my Panasonic 1080p camera does fine with a rated 4 SD card and putting a rated 6 SD card into the Aiptek did n't help .
p3336
aVThe 3D effect is real and looks great .
p3337
aVThe image quality itself is ok , but in addition to the bad framerate there are jaggies all over the place .
p3338
aVYou might not notice on a smaller TV , but on my 58 '' C7000 it is quite visible .
p3339
aVIt 's certainly easy to use .
p3340
aVTurn on , point and shoot .
p3341
aVIt does have a slight digital zoom by moving the joystick up and down , but it 's mostly useless .
p3342
aVThe audio is fairly good with stereo 2.0 .
p3343
aVThe built-in speaker is clear too .
p3344
aVThe parallax screen is neato if you are right in the sweet spot , but that can be tricky to find .
p3345
aVIt really is cool that it is so small and fits in your pocket almost like a cell phone .
p3346
aVI got a 32GB SD card that said it had 15 hours of record time !
p3347
aVI decided that really was n't necessary so I swapped it out with the 8GB card from my 1080p camcorder and that says I have 4 hours of record time so it 's pretty efficient with space .
p3348
aVDo n't expect miracles .
p3349
aVLike someone else said , it 's a 3D camera for $ 199 .
p3350
aVI 'm sure later generations will have dramatically improved video but for a 1st gen machine I 'm pretty happy with it .
p3351
aVBecause of the lousy frame rate and jaggies my 1080p camera has nothing to worry about .
p3352
aVUPDATE : This camera has frozen up several times now , necessitating removal of the battery to turn it off .
p3353
aVUnfortunately , this wipes whatever you recorded since you last turned it on .
p3354
aVI took my son to his first pumpkin patch and this camera froze and erased ALL OF IT !
p3355
aVPretty ticked off about that in particular .
p3356
aVI would recommend recording short clips and turning the camera off and on in between to make sure you do n't lose them .
p3357
aVAll these problems are really starting to add up and it 's feeling like far less of a good deal now .
p3358
aV1 -RRB- `` wobbly '' warping of the image .
p3359
aV2 -RRB- horrific frame rate that makes recording any sort of movement look bad .
p3360
aV3 -RRB- Pixelly image when viewed on large screen .
p3361
aV4 -RRB- Parallax barrier screen only works at very precise angles , and still kind of bothers your eyes .
p3362
aVThings close to screen will be badly double-imaged even though they look fine on the TV .
p3363
aV5 -RRB- Freezing which erases recordings .
p3364
aVUPDATE 3-15-2011 I have updated the firmware via the european site .
p3365
aVAt first it seems like an improvement because the video is no longer choppy .
p3366
aVYou quickly realize that you are trading clarity for smoothness .
p3367
aVNow instead of a choppy , clear image , you get a smooth image filled with motion blur .
p3368
aVThat 's worse in my estimation because unless you are recording something that 's barely moving and you keep the camera utterly still , it will come out looking like an acid flashback because of all the trails and blur .
p3369
aVHowever I have n't had any more freeze-ups but then who really cares when the image looks crappy ?
p3370
aa(lp3371
VI am satisfied with the purchase and wait for the camera from the description is very well and so far I have not had any problems
p3372
aa(lp3373
VBought from amazon.com !
p3374
aVPaid for next day did not receive .
p3375
aVAfter charging the camera for the recommended time , the LCD screen was extremely hot to the touch and camera would not show any picture !
p3376
aVDo not buy this camera !
p3377
aVI asked for all my money back and will not buy from amazon.com again !
p3378
aVThe way they have handled this is not customer service !
p3379
aVToday is January 21 and still not heard from this company !
p3380
aVAlso I had to pay for the shipping back to amazon !
p3381
aVThanks for nothing !
p3382
aa(lp3383
VI now own a N60 which does not work with an external flash , I would like to know before purchasing this one if the external flash would work with it .
p3384
aa(lp3385
VAmazon had the best price of this camera after I seached for several providers .
p3386
aVThe quality is pretty good too .
p3387
aa(lp3388
VI just bought the FI8904W camera to go along with the Foscam FI8918W camera I bought earlier .
p3389
aVI was disappointed to find that the field-of-view for the FI8904W was much tighter than the F8918W , even though both are title listed by Amazon as `` 3.6 mm lens , 67-deg viewing angle '' .
p3390
aVI went to the foscam.com website -LRB- not foscam .
p3391
aVus -RRB- and found the spec sheet for the FI8904W .
p3392
aVIt states a `` 6mm lens and 42-degree viewing angle '' .
p3393
aVI found that the narrow FOV made it inadequate for outdoor patio coverage .

aV-LRB- For the tinkers out there you can buy replacement lenses .
p3395
aVGoogle `` IP camera lenses '' -RRB- .
p3396
aVIt 's really too bad it does n't come with the same lens as the FI8918W .
p3397
aVAlso , the camera does not have auto-brightness , which can be a problem if you want to view in both bright sun and darkness .
p3398
aVOn a positive note , it was not too difficult to set up in both wired and wireless modes and the construction seems solid and water resistant .
p3399
aVI returned mine but would have kept it if it were n't for the narrow FOV .

VThis camera is by far the best super zoom , point and shoot camera one can own in terms of picture quality .
p3402
aVI bought it just 2 weeks back and took it out with my friends on 2 photography trips with all types and brand of cameras in the group - point and shoot , super zoom , and SLRs -LRB- From Sony to Canon to Fuji to Nikon -RRB- .
p3403
aVEverybody was in awe looking at the quality of pictures of all kinds - portrait , macro , super zoom , day scenery , low light etc. this camera produced .
p3404
aVIn some cases , it was as good as or even better than the SLRs !!
p3405
aVI am in love with the camera and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants great pictures and manual controls but ca n't afford an SLR .
p3406
aa(lp3407
VI had the same problems as others did .
p3408
aVI am glad that I tested this out before it was too late to return it .
p3409
aVI only used this once with a brand new Sony miniDV tape .
p3410
aVIt was OK the first time I played it , but the picture dropped out the second time around ... pixelation ... sound drops out ... If this happens with one tape , I would hate to imagine what happens in a year when the warranty runs out .

p3418

VExcellent point-and-shoot camera .
p3420
aVSmall for pocket use .
p3421
aVThe LiIon battery is unique , but lasts a long , long time .
p3422
aVQuite happy with Canon - chosen for short lag from pressing the button until shutter snaps .
p3423
aa(lp3424
VI love this camera !!
p3425
aVI 'm somewhat a novice , but am learning and this makes it easy for beginners , plus has lots of features for more advanced users , so I can grow into it .
p3426
aa(lp3427
VI bought this camera primarily for business as I perform inspections for insurance companies .
p3428
aVThe first weekend I had the camera , I stayed at home playing with all the features it offered and was blown away with all it could do .
p3429
aVI thought it was the best camera I had ever owned .
p3430
aVThen reality set in and I found out it will only put a date stamp on a photo if you PRINT the photo .
p3431
aVSony 's logic is that it ruins a photograph .
p3432
aVUnfortunately , the companies to which I send my photo files want to see a date .
p3433
aVThe only other option is to add a date manually using digital photo software and can only be done one photo at a time .
p3434
aVAlso , as other reviews mention , the battery drains faster than an F-22 Raptor on afterburner .
p3435
aVSo , if you do n't mind buying an extra battery or two and can live without a date stamp this is a great camera !
p3436
aa(lp3437
VI patiently researched and waited 2 months before buying this camera , and was slightly disappointed with blue specks showing up on the LCD screen when pointing the camera into darkness\u005c/black objects .
p3438
aVI only saw one other reviewer comment on this issue and I 'm surprised this was n't commented more often in other reviews , because this is a very big negative .
p3439
aa(lp3440
VEasy to use .
p3441
aVMany features .
p3442
aVGreat for a novice or a more sophisticated photo-enthusiast .
p3443
aVExceptional price for a versatile camera .
p3444
aa(lp3445
VThis system alarms every time the sun comes up , or goes down , and every time a cloud goes past the sun .
p3446
aVAlso , as the sun moves , the shadows cast by tall trees on the driveway trips the alarm .
p3447
aVSo on a intermittent cloudy day the two transmitters that I have are tripped almost continuously all day long .
p3448
aVOptexAmerica says they are aware of the problem but have no solution .
p3449
aVTo be clear , it is not the sun hitting the transmitters , it is the general sunlight changing on the driveway surface .
p3450
aVThis system might work well indoors , but not anywhere that 's sunny !
p3451
aVHard to believe , I agree !
p3452
aVWorks well at night .
p3453
aa(lp3454
VI bought this camera as a gift for my technology challenged Mom , right before her trip to Europe .
p3455
aVI was a little worried because she did not have the chance to use the camera before leaving and was not likely to spend the flight reading the manual .
p3456
aVI gave her a quick lesson in loading the film and deciding between the three settings and off she went .
p3457
aVWell , the pictures she brought back were just amazing !
p3458
aVThere were a few mishaps , Mom 's fault not the camera 's , but overall the photos were outstanding .
p3459
aVAlso the compact size allowed her to take it along all the time , so she got several photos other people missed because they did not have cameras with them .
p3460
aVShe just loves taking pictures now and the advantix system makes keeping up with all of them so easy .
p3461
aVThis is one amazing little camera !
p3462
aa(lp3463
VThis camera is a very nice item for snapshots as well as some more sophisticatied photography .
p3464
aVReasonable price .
p3465
aVGood 4x optical zoom , which is better than most .
p3466
aVLarge and fairly bright screen for composing and reviewing photos .
p3467
aVWhat I really like , with my aging eyes is , when you change modes , the way it briefly displays a large icon on the screen identifying the new setting .
p3468
aVThe icon then fades to its smaller size and peripheral location .
p3469
aVOlder Canons did n't do this .
p3470
aa(lp3471
Vthe camera is very easy to use and i was looking for a camera that would give me the professional look with out the professional price .
p3472
aVi definitely got it in this camera !
p3473
aVit is very easy to take along as well as most girls do n't want a huge camera in there purse this little camera definitely has the compact look with the professional pictures !
p3474
aVvery happy with my choice .
p3475
aa(lp3476
VThis is a good camera .
p3477
aVI wanted a camcorder for a recent vacation .
p3478
aVI shopped around  tried the cameras in the stores .
p3479
aVI originally wanted a panasonic with 700x zoom , but found that a digital zoom over 120x is worthless .
p3480
aVThis camera had better resolution , better night vision , a great feature to slow the shutter down in low light conditions , but still get color , interval recording -LRB- i.e. record for .5 seconds , every 30 seconds or such ... neat to watch a plant grow or such -RRB- , remote control -LRB- great to get in the shot -RRB- , a nice sized screen , fits the hand well .

VI LOVE this camera !
p3487
aVI have had other digital cameras before and they both broke .
p3488
aVI decided to get a Canon this time and have had no problems with it so far .
p3489
aVIt 's great for taking pictures of my son or when I 'm out with friends .
p3490
aVI would recommend Canon to anyone .
p3491
aVAlso the delivery was fast and everything came that I paid for .
p3492
aa(lp3493
VAlthough I have n't had the opportunity to use this camera extensively , I find it easy to use and satisfactory in performance .
p3494
aa(lp3495
VAfter having the Nikon D50 i was thinking i was not going to like any cameras. , but this one is much better .
p3496
aVlovely pictures !

p3498
aVi love it !
p3499
aVi got this camera just today i cant stop looking at the pictures !
p3500
aVgo for this camera .
p3501
aVits cheap its nice .
p3502
aV3 INCH LCD !
p3503
aVWHAT ELSE YOU WANT ?
p3504
aa(lp3505
Vas it seems to be the few point-and-shoot cams that still run on AA batteries , i initially ordered this to make use of the eneloops from the previous gadgets .
p3506
aVat least power replacements are readily available ; incase the rechargable batteries die out , just pop in any pair of AAs .
p3507
aVthere 's not much in terms of manual adjustments as it caters to an array of automated settings and megapixel size options .
p3508
aValso i have n't figured out how to make the image stabilization work properly ... one thing i love is that it can use sd cards and memory stick pro duos .
p3509
aVonly downside to using sd cards may be the load time per shot is a tad bit slower .
p3510
aVover all , it 's a satisfying pocketable instacam for its price .
p3511
aa(lp3512
VThis does not ship with Mac OSX compatible software and quicktime 7 and quicktime x , maccam , mixscope , proscope , evo cam and photobooth do not see this device .
p3513
aVIf you use Mac OSX do n't waste your time as you will only be making a return .
p3514
aa(lp3515
VI wanted to see how well this camera would actually function as a carry-around for quick grabs of interesting things which happen too fast to dig a camera out of a bag .
p3516
aVBeing very pocketable , it is easy to carry in shirt or pants pockets , provided you take into consideration the delicate nature of the LCD screen and thin lens cover .
p3517
aVAnyone who reads my other reviews of cameras and electronics will know that I am no fan of proprietary rechargeable batteries .
p3518
aVI think they are wasteful and unnecessary complications , requiring one to purchase extra batteries which can only be used on one device , then must be discarded .
p3519
aVGiven that we already have international standards for battery designs -LRB- including rechargeable -RRB- , I find it a poor design choice created primarily to bilk customers out of more hard-earned cash .
p3520
aVThat said , I will have to admit that this camera has changed my mind a little in that regard .
p3521
aVI am still using my very first charge on the included battery , and have not had to recharge it yet .
p3522
aVNow , I only shoot it for limited periods of time , and not every day , but the charge is holding far better than I expected , even when not in use .
p3523
aVAnother strong point is that I can get extra batteries from a third party for little more than the price of a 4-pack of lithium AA batteries , which means that I can easily carry several charged batteries for about the same cost as one-use batteries .
p3524
aVThis makes it much more attractive , even though I am still limited to the charged batteries I have on hand .
p3525
aVI have even bought 2 extra batteries to test this out .
p3526
aVI will update if there are any significant additional things to report .
p3527
aVThe other thing that has made this camera far more attractive to me is its macro capability .
p3528
aVAs an old geezer with eyes not quite so good as in my youth , I find it more and more difficult to read the increasingly microscopic text being printed on increasingly smaller electronic devices , such as wall wart power supplies , and have found that this camera works extremely well for taking pictures in macro mode and zooming in to make them very readable .
p3529
aVI have also used this camera to reach inside equipment racks to take pictures to document equipment connections -LRB- which were undocumented -RRB- before making changes or moving gear .
p3530
aVIt has worked very well for that .
p3531
aVIt has become my camera of choice for everyday carry-around use , and although it is not as easy to use as my favorite Canon 720 IS , I am finding that it functions reasonably well for most things .
p3532
aVThe lack of an optical viewfinder makes it difficult for those of us with glasses , especially in the bright sunlight , but the LCD can be made bright enough to see well enough to frame shots with an acceptable level of usefulness .
p3533
aVIt would be better if the LCD were not glossy , however , as reflection in bright light makes it more difficult to use .
p3534
aVThe picture quality is good , although I have n't done any hard comparisons with my other cameras yet .
p3535
aVI was shooting at the 5 megapixel size for a while to save space on the 1gb card , but have since replaced that with an 8gb card and will test at full resolution .
p3536
aVAll in all , I am happily surprised and looking to using and testing this camera more in the future .
p3537
aVI will update with any significant information .
p3538
aVWithin its limitations , I would recommend this camera .
p3539
aVUPDATE No. 13 , 2011 I used the video recording feature for the first time recently , and I was extremely impressed .
p3540
aVThe video was very clear and sharp , and the audio was amazing for the tiny mic placed on top of the camera .
p3541
aVThe more I use this camera , the more I like it .
p3542
aVIt has become very useful in my life .
p3543
aVUPDATE : Dec. 17 , 2011 I have seen some references to Panasonic has changing their batteries in later models so one can not use third party batteries , but must purchase the vastly more expensive Panasonic ones .
p3544
aVIf that is true , that makes this camera even more valuable , as one can still get replacement batteries from third parties .
p3545
aVShame on you Panasonic , if that is true .
p3546
aa(lp3547
VI had high hopes for this camera .
p3548
aVI tried to do my homework and investigate it , but it does n't give the quality action shots I was hoping for .
p3549
aVBummed !
p3550
aa(lp3551
VAfter doing much research and wanting to upgrade from my Panasonic TZ5 -LRB- 10x Optical -RRB- , I decided to try the Pentax for the greater zoom range ... boy what a disappointment !
p3552
aVHaving owned several Digital Point and Shoots , this has to be the worst I have tried .
p3553
aVI would normally try the camera before reading the manual , then read the manual to see what I may be missing .
p3554
aVWith this one though , I promptly read the entire manual while the battery was charging .
p3555
aVI was hoping to be able to get decent photos using both preset settings and my own , unfortunately after taking over 1000 photos - only a handful came out as `` keepers '' .
p3556
aVFor the most part even up close birds came out blurred regardless of using the preset or my own settings .
p3557
aVNo matter what I tried I could not get this thing to focus correctly .
p3558
aVAnother big draw back was the resolution of the LED screen , it would flash for a second to show a clear image , then go back to fuzz - it was hit or miss when you pressed the shutter button and most were misses .
p3559
aVThe screen never stayed focused on your subject even though the camera 's little green boxes tried to say you were in focus , you could n't tell using the LED or the Viewfinder as both stayed fuzzy at all times .
p3560
aVThe few shots I did get that came out not blurry - the colors are washed out compared to my TZ5 .
p3561
aVAs for using the zoom - if you plan on zooming in on inanimate objects such as buildings - it worked ok .
p3562
aVIf you plan on zooming in anything that may sway a bit , or breath - forget it - all photos are fuzzed or extremely soft around the edges .
p3563
aVI get much clearer shots at the same distance away using only my 10x optical on the TZ5 .
p3564
aVSurprisingly enough the best set of images I got , I took while holding my camera out the truck window and not looking at the LED screen or viewfinder at all .
p3565
aVI took this camera with me on a fishing trip with some friends we had not seen in a while - after about 30 minutes of being frustrated and not getting any images worth keeping , this camera got put away and I pulled out my old trusty TZ5 .
p3566
aVMy friends were amazed at the photos it took , while they just shook their heads at the Pentax photos .
p3567
aVIf you are into photographing bugs , flowers , and anything else up real close -LRB- Macros -RRB- this camera maybe what you want , as I did note the best images were those using Macro and Super Macro settings ... one plus amongst the all other minuses .
p3568
aVI have packaged this one up , and have ordered the Panasonic DMC TZ35 .
p3569
aVSummary : Pros - Awesome Macros Cons - slow to focus -LRB- if you can get it to focus -RRB- LED stays fuzzy after only a short flash of a clear image on the screen -LRB- could n't tell whether you are really focused or not - had to try and rely on the camera 's green boxes and beep - which was n't reliable either -RRB- Zoom causes much blur and softness to anything that may move in the slightest Lens cap falls off very easily I should have listened to the one other reviewer here that also sent theirs back .
p3570
aVI thought maybe they got a bad camera -LRB- lemon -RRB- ... now I know
p3571
aa(lp3572
VI picked this little gem up at the Sony store less than a month ago .
p3573
aVThey had all their camcorder models lined up on the shelf and the HC90 stood out like a Beauty Queen on a Catwalk .
p3574
aVThe overall design is an aesthetic masterpiece and fits ever-so perfectly in the palm of one 's hand .
p3575
aVIt is super light weight and you can carry it around effortlessly for hours -LRB- it is compact enough to fit in your trouser pocket -RRB- .
p3576
aVAll the basic controls are easily accessible to thumb and fingers , and it could n't be easier to operate .
p3577
aVThis is my first camcorder so I was under the impression that I would have some intensive study of the included manual ahead of me .
p3578
aVI was mistaken .
p3579
aVAll I had to do was skim the first few pages and I was off and running -LRB- albeit in Easy Mode -RRB- .
p3580
aVI have read some critical reviews of Sony camcorders bemoaning their compatibility with third party components , such as PC 's .
p3581
aVNothing further could be from the truth !
p3582
aVI own a Mac Powerbook .
p3583
aVI took a few snaps in Picture Mode and the USB cable loaded them seamlessly into iPhoto .
p3584
aVI picked up a cheap 4 to 6 pin Firewire cable at RadioShack , connected the device to my Powerbook and iMovie instantly downloaded the widescreen video footage without any prompting .
p3585
aVAnd it was the same ease of operation in connecting it to my TV , my VCR and my DVD player .
p3586
aVI can honestly say that I have never encountered a piece of high technology that operated with such ease and joyful simplicity .
p3587
aVI have already shot hours of video without further consulting of the manual and the included software disc remains in its sealed envelope .
p3588
aVThis little gem seems almost organic in its construction and operation .
p3589
aVAt 3.3 MP , the still photos are quite excellent and the panoramic option is a real cool feature .
p3590
aVThe video is superb .
p3591
aVI live out in the forest and I can only describe the image quality as true to life .
p3592
aVThe built in microphone is excellent .
p3593
aVWhen I reviewed some footage shot out in the swamp it was as though the bull frogs were singing right in my living room !
p3594
aVThe only drawback is that it amplifies anything stronger than a light breeze , but I found that this can be minimized by closing the LCD display and taking advantage of the camcorders sleek exterior design .
p3595
aVThe battery life can also prove irksome if you like extended shootings .
p3596
aVBut for a modest investment you can purchase a battery with twice the life .
p3597
aVDo I like my new DCR-HC90 Camcorder ?
p3598
aVNo !
p3599
aVI absolutely LOVE it !!!
p3600
aVIt is so portable and easy to use that you can just take it everywhere without even thinking about it , and it attracts looks of admiration and envy wherever it goes .
p3601
aVThe one I bought was the last one in stock .
p3602
aVThe salesman whom attended to me said the model was selling like hot cakes , and even though it was the priciest item on display , they were literaly flying off the shelves into the eager hands of happy customers .
p3603
aVIt is easy to see why .
p3604
aVI have a Canon G6 , a fine device in its own right .
p3605
aVSince I acquired my HC90 , it is more or less collecting cobwebs in a forgotten corner of my cabin .
p3606
aa(lp3607
VComming from a nikon dslr , i was looking for a smaller more portable camera without sacrificing image quality .
p3608
aVThe nikon 1 j1 is perfect it performs outstandingly well in all situations and lighting and it is easy to use .
p3609
aVI also love it because nikon makes a converter so you can use any nikor mount lens .
p3610
aVIf youre looking for a step up from a point and shoot or a step down from a dslr this camera is the best of both worlds !
p3611
aa(lp3612
VI wo n't go into all the technical specs of this camera because the other reviewers have already done an excellent job of doing that .
p3613
aVI bought my pv-gs200 2 years ago and it 's really an amazing and value packed product .
p3614
aVThey 're a little tough to find new now but I would imagine a refurb would be of equal quality .
p3615
aVThe # 1 reason why I purchased the gs200 is because it has a manual focus ring .
p3616
aVI can use it for stills and full motion video .
p3617
aVThis is a huge benefit , especially in low light shots .
p3618
aVThe color reproduction on the GS200 is spot on .
p3619
aVI recently shot a family reunion at a beach in Long Island NY and discovered that if you capture the video in an uncompressed format using an app like Sony Vegas , you get results comparable to that of a higher end broadcast quality camera .
p3620
aVFor me , figuring this out was like unlocking the cameras true potential .
p3621
aVI highly recommend this camera for the steady handed .
p3622
aVIt 's ideal for tripod use too !
p3623
aVCheck out a video of my nephew picking his nose with both fingers , filmed with the GS200 and rendered as a an mpeg layer 2 file .

VWanted a better digital camera for a trip to Brazil .
p3629
aVDid online research and wanted one around 8MP , but settled for the Canon A620 .
p3630
aVWas a bit concerned when I got my camera through the mail as the packing was substandard .
p3631
aVHowever , I took around 10 test pictures that looked okay , then went on an 8-day trip to Brazil .
p3632
aVGot some awesome pictures ... around 300 or so .
p3633
aVThe macro photo of some leaf-cutter ants also was pretty impressive .
p3634
aVThe only regret -LRB- non-A620 related -RRB- I have , is that I had 2x1GB SD cards and the first one did n't even get filled up even with mid-high res photos , and the 2nd card did n't even get used .
p3635
aVI was too busy checking things out instead of taking more photos .
p3636
aVOh well !
p3637
aVI plan to return to Brazil ... it 's an awesome country esp Rio de Janeiro .
p3638
aVWhat I like about the Camera : after taking over 300 photos , many with flash , the batteries where still going strong .
p3639
aVI used 2500mh nickel-metal hydride batteries .
p3640
aVThe clarity and color of the pics are very good\u005c/accurate , and there was never any hint of red-eye in the people photos , not one !
p3641
aVCamera is easy to use and I basically only used the auto , program and landscape modes and still got some excellent shots .
p3642
aVI keep the flip screen in the `` open '' position ... ca n't be bothered with flipping it open\u005c/closed all the time .
p3643
aVBottom line : Great camera performancewise , and not too small where it could slip out of your hand and smash onto the ground .
p3644
aVCanon should make another similar model , maybe with higher megapixels and dump the flip screen , thereby still keeping the price around the same as the A620 .
p3645
aVGuaranteed sales !!

VI have not used this product enough to go into detail .
p3648
aVI have used it on many occasions and have loved the picture quality and size .
p3649
aVOne thing I dislike is the weight on my neck .
p3650
aVIt is not too heavy , however , after walking\u005c/hiking the strap is hot and heavy on the back of my neck .
p3651
aVI may invest in a harness-type to remove this discomfort .
p3652
aVI still gave it 5 stars b\u005c/c the binoculars themselves are wonderful !
p3653
aa(lp3654
VI was disappointed in the quality of the camera .
p3655
aVI got it for $ 29.99 on a cyber Monday deal at CVS .
p3656
aVIt has a light but works poorly .
p3657
aVWell lit areas are not picked up by the camera , and the zoom is awkward .
p3658
aVEach click of the zoom button awkwardly jumps a frame .
p3659
aVIt 's chinsy .
p3660
aVThis is junk .
p3661
aVYou 're much better off with a flip ultra camcorder - works good in the light but picture jumps as you move your hand .
p3662
aVPlus , Vivitar DVR508 makes a buzzing sound on the microphone .
p3663
aVWarrarty people were of no help at all .

VRecently purchased the camera to take to Cancun in 3 weeks and decided to take to the river first to test it out .
p3666
aVTook it to the pool at the hotel and it took great pictures  video under water .
p3667
aVEveryone at the pool wanted to see the camera .
p3668
aVThey could n't believe it could take pics and video under water .
p3669
aVHeard a couple of people saying they will soon get one .
p3670
aVTook to the river the following day and it began to rain and the camera worked like a charm .
p3671
aVTook some great video of us inner tubing and when everyone had to put their cameras away for the rain , I had mine out taking pics of all the great times we had .
p3672
aVI read some reviews where there were some difective cameras and thankfully , mine was not one of them .
p3673
aVI would recommend the purchase of this camera but 1 .
p3674
aVMake sure to have extra batteries on hand in your case -LRB- had to change mine after a day but I did use all day long -RRB- 2 .
p3675
aVRecommend you purchase the floating wrist strap as the camera does not float -LRB- I will purchase one for our trip to Cancun -RRB- .
p3676
aa(lp3677
VI love this camera , I bought it for my grandma for Christmas , and she loves it .
p3678
aVIt is easy for her to use , and it takes great pictures .
p3679
aa(lp3680
VIf you are looking for a 35MM point-and-shoot zoom , do n't look any farther than this little beauty .
p3681
aVIt takes great pictures , the flash is automatic and unobtrusive , and the little extras -LRB- timer , extra flash modes , water resistant , date  time stamp -RRB- just make it better .
p3682
aVWhat I really like about it is its small size .
p3683
aVIt easily fits into a pocket or comfortably in your hand , so taking quick snapshots is a breeze .
p3684
aVNo fumbling around in a camera case -LRB- or even removing it from a carrying case -RRB- is necessary ... just open it , point , and click !
p3685
aV One note : It does n't come with the required battery -LRB- DL123 -RRB- .\u000aNNP CD NN : PRP VBZ RB VBN IN DT VBN NN -LRB- NN -RRB- .\u000a one note : it do not come with the require battery -lrb- dl123 -rrb- .\u000a\u000a

p3688
aVI purchased one and when I tried to use it , it just said card error .
p3689
aVTurned out the camera was defective .
p3690
aVI tried to return it , but there was a glitch in the return process so that was a no-go .
p3691
aVI emailed the seller .

VI 've had digital camera 's since 2002 , and I 've experimented with 3D off and on , over the years .
p3700
aVThis is the first camera that makes it easy !
p3701
aVI was concerned about how good the 3D effect would be , but the viewing screen is quite impressive in 3D , everyone I 've shown it to says `` wow '' or something similar .
p3702
aVI ca n't wait to see what the -LRB- rather expensive , at $ 6.99 each -RRB- prints look like .
p3703
aVI ca n't afford a 3D TV yet , but at least I can take some 3D shots and video -LRB- also very impressive on the screen , since you do n't need special glasses for the 3D effect -RRB- while the kids are young , and get a 3D TV after prices come down .
p3704
aVI have n't tried all the various settings yet ; the 2D shots are OK , I like my Canon Powershot SX200 IS better for that .
p3705
aVThe battery life is quite short , probably less than 1 hour , and I had a problem with video recording shutting off after 4 minutes or so .
p3706
aVI later read not formatting the card can cause this , I 'm going to try it later .
p3707
aVthe 3D files -LRB- .
p3708
aVMPO -RRB- are really just 2 jpg files stored together , but only the Fuji software will download them so far : iPhoto and Picasa wo n't .
p3709
aVI should get a card reader , but I 've always found it easier to connect a cable to the camera for downloading .
p3710
aVI 'd love to have an option of another place to get prints from , but I 'm sure that 'll happen sooner or later .
p3711
aVBottom line , if you like 3D , you 'll love this camera !
p3712
aa(lp3713
VThis camera is amazing !!
p3714
aVI started with the 505 , and then moved up to the 707 .

VI bought this camcorder for my teen daughter for Christmas in 2003 .
p3722
aVPer the product description , it is loaded with features and appeared to be a great value .
p3723
aVHowever , after about six months of light usage , the circuit board went bad -LRB- according to an authorized repair center -RRB- and the camera will no longer charge the battery .
p3724
aVWe took it for repairs after the warranty period and the cost to fix it is about the same price as buying a new one .
p3725
aVWe can still use the camera , but I had to buy a charger and extra batts .
p3726
aVConsidering the problems with this model noted on this and other websites , it would be nice if JVC would offer an exchange program for a less problematic model .
p3727
aa(lp3728
VBottom line : For the price , I would n't consider any other camcorder .
p3729
aVI 'm not a pro by any means , but I do enjoy good quality movies .
p3730
aVI did some experimentation and found this to be a great camcorder for the money .
p3731
aVWhen you spend sub-300 for a camcorder , your expectations should n't be set very high .
p3732
aVHowever , the quality I got was well above my expectations .
p3733
aVIt has settings from SD -LRB- 480p at 30fps -RRB- all the way up to 1080p at 60 fps .
p3734
aVOut of the box , it was set for SD .
p3735
aVPicture quality was terrible , so I immediately changed it .
p3736
aVI scanned through all the quality settings and took some sample videos .
p3737
aVIf you want great quality video in low light and fast action conditions , stick with 720p at 30 fps .
p3738
aVIf you want better looking video on your big screen in everyday well lit conditions , you can opt for the 1080p at 60 fps .
p3739
aVOutdoors , this was my favorite , giving stunning quality .
p3740
aVHowever , if you want a happy medium , try the 1080p at 30fps setting .
p3741
aVIt gave me consistent results in indoor and outdoor video .
p3742
aVIndoor , the low light capabilities seen in other reviews stand out , while also offering great looking HD video outside .
p3743
aVI have n't seen the focus problems others have been reporting , but then again I have n't placed it on a tripod for lengthy amounts of time either .
p3744
aVIt does have the ability to mount filters onto its threaded lens , but I have n't acquired any of the right size filters .
p3745
aVI would be most interested in a circular polarizer though .
p3746
aVThat would make outdoor videos look killer .
p3747
aVA pretty cool feature with this camcorder is its ability to shoot high speed -LRB- or slo motion -RRB- video .
p3748
aVIt can take up to 600 fps .
p3749
aVHowever , the resolution is severely degraded .
p3750
aVIt 's not even worth taking the video because its such a tiny resolution .
p3751
aVPretty interesting to see basic things in slow mo though .
p3752
aVOne interesting thing I noticed about this camera , a 2 minute SD video gave me a 350 MB video file , while a 5 minute 1080 video gave me a 100 MB file .
p3753
aVFor some reason SD video stores at incredibly high bitrates .
p3754
aVDunno why , but I wo n't ever be using that setting anyway so it does n't matter .
p3755
aVIt just took up way too much memory card space for my liking .
p3756
aVStill photos are OK , but I wo n't be shelving my DSLR anytime soon .
p3757
aVIt 's surprisingly flexible with stills , giving you full manual control over aperture , shutter speed , and ISO , and yields great looking pictures most of the time .
p3758
aVIt also utilizes its full zoom range , which is useful for telephoto .
p3759
aVHowever , it 's kind of slow at taking pictures , and awkward to hold steady while shooting .
p3760
aVNo flash mount , so you have to deal with the point-and-shoot style built-in flash .
p3761
aVBottom line , it 's very nice to have the ability to take decent pictures without having to switch out devices , but will never replace a good camera .
p3762
aVI also wanted to comment on file types .
p3763
aVVideo is MP4 , encoded with H. 264 video and AAC audio .
p3764
aVIt 's the Apple standard , so it plays well with Macs right out of the box .
p3765
aVIt also played nicely on my Windows 7 and Ubuntu machines as well .
p3766
aVHowever , my MacBook Pro did n't like the slow motion video I took .
p3767
aVThere 's obviously no audio because it would be distorted at 600 fps anyway .
p3768
aVPreview showed a still of the video , but Quicktime just showed a black screen as it played .
p3769
aVWindows and Ubuntu both played it back just fine .
p3770
aVI uploaded a 1080p file directly off the SD card into Facebook and it worked great .
p3771
aVHave n't tried YouTube but I know youtube loves H. 264 so I would imagine it works great too .
p3772
aVIt would be nice for the camera to allow different codecs , but why not just go with industry standard ?
p3773
aa(lp3774
VI think that this camera is great .
p3775
aVI like that it is compact making it very easy to keep with you .
p3776
aVThe picture quality is great I have taken far shots and close-ups .
p3777
aVThe color from the pictures are so full .
p3778
aVThis camera has many features such as manually setting the AWB -LRB- auto white balance -RRB- or you can have the camera do it in the auto setting .
p3779
aVI like the 3 minute video feature .
p3780
aVNow nothing is perfect so this is what I do n't like about the camera .
p3781
aVFirst is you do n't know how much battery life there is for the camera so best bet is to keep an extra battery available .
p3782
aVI recommend getting the 256mb of memory the 16mb that comes with the camera is simply not enough .
p3783
aVAlso I do n't like the switch on the camera that is used to go between still pictures , video , and replay\u005c/download .
p3784
aVThe switch moves to easily it should have a little more resistance .
p3785
aVI like compact and quality prints , and many options this camera was for me .
p3786
aa(lp3787
VThis is not the best camcorder for the price .
p3788
aVThe only two things I liked about it were the video quality is very good and it is very small and easy to bring with you .
p3789
aVI give this camcorder two stars because the built in rechargeible battery does not last long at all .
p3790
aVYou charge it for four hours and you maybe get one hour of battery life .
p3791
aVAlso the sound quality is not that great either .
p3792
aVIf you are talking the sound comes out ok .
p3793
aVBut if you are recording something far away it barly picks up the sound .
p3794
aVWhen you record for a long period of time the camcorder gets very hot .
p3795
aVI would recomend the flip ultrahd 2nd generation camcorder .
p3796
aVThe video and sound quality are very good .
p3797
aVIt also comes with a recharible battery pack giving you about 2.5 hours of battery time .
p3798
aVIt is a little more expensive but it is worth it .
p3799
aVI would only recomend this camcorder to people who only need to take a few minutes of video and who are not filming from far away .
p3800
aa(lp3801
VThis does work for what I bought it for but my problem with it is that the box clearly states `` Made In The USA Sold Worldwide '' , but on the bottom of the suction cup it says `` Made In China '' .
p3802
aVI try to buy products made in the USA and I do n't mind paying more for them , but when the box says made in the USA and the item has made in china on it something is wrong .
p3803
aa(lp3804
VCamera seems great , however ... HOW THE HECK DO YOU GET IT OFF THE BASE THAT IT CAME PACKAGED ON ???
p3805
aV... ahem , sorry .
p3806

p3807
aVI ca n't even get it off of the little stand it came on ... Any help ?
p3808
aa(lp3809

p3815
aVSaludos desde Paraguay .
p3816
aa(lp3817
VThis camera is very satisfactory , when you consider the price .
p3818

aa(lp3820
VI bought this camera just before I traveled to Europe .
p3821
aVIt 's always good to check out a new camera before you go on vacation with it , -LRB- so you can get to know it and see the results ... nothing worse than coming back from a vacation like that with a bunch of garbage rolls of film as your memories -RRB- .
p3822
aVI was SO happy with the results of the test roll before I left , that I shot another roll `` to test '' it , and then another ... the images are SO sharp and clear !
p3823
aVI had VERY FEW pictures that did n't turn out from my entire trip .
p3824
aVGood exposures , clear focus ... The camera was overall quite adaptable to the various elements a person may come across while on vacation or just out taking pictures at a family event .

p3836
aVthere were some bad but also there were a lot of really good ones .
p3837
aVi bought the camera the next day and had it put on next day delivery cause i was going on a disnay trip with my band so i need it quick .
p3838
aVi dident get the next day beacuse it has to have a day to process so the title next day delivery is really misleading .
p3839
aVbut i got it in time for the trip and i dident know how well it would do .
p3840
aVso i took it into the pool first and did some underwataer shooting and took it back to my hotel room to see how well it did .
p3841
aVI was astonished when i saw how good the picture qualtiy was .
p3842
aVit was amizing and i have been using it on my motorcycle when ever i got out riding to get a cool up close and personal shot of cars and other bickers .
p3843
aVi love this camera and i think anyone who wants a good res camerea and dosent care about the sound get this cam cause it has good res but the sound isent that good .
p3844
aVBUT I FOUND OUT ON YOUTUBE IF YOU REMOVE THE ORINGS YOU CAN HAVE REALLY REALLY GOOD SOUND !

VI am not very knowledgeable about the technicalities of photography\u005c/cameras , but I need to take good photos for various projects .
p3849
aVThis camera was recommended to me by a talented photographer friend .
p3850
aVGoing from a pocket point and shoot to this is amazing .
p3851
aVIt makes beautiful pictures , has so many easy to understand settings and focuses\u005c/shoots instantly ... I used to get so frustrated waiting for my old camera to focus and decide if it felt like actually taking the picture .
p3852
aVCa n't give tech specs on why I like it , but if like me you need to take beautiful , professional looking photos , but have limited knowledge about cameras - it 's a great camera ...
p3853
aa(lp3854
VPlusses - 12X zoom with anti-shake lets you take pictures of things that are difficult to capture otherwise .
p3855
aVFor example , I take quite a few pictures of my animals , and when you get close to them , they tend to move .
p3856
aVThis camera lets you maintain your distance and get a good shot .
p3857
aV- Video mode is good .
p3858
aVHigh res , and works surprisingly well in low light .
p3859
aV- Very good ergonomics as far as controls are concerned .
p3860
aVMenus for various camera modes are well laid out .
p3861
aV- Exceedingly fast operation .
p3862
aVTurn it on , and it is ready to go .
p3863
aVRepeated shots are also very fast .
p3864
aV- Easy access to real time histogram of current image .
p3865
aV- Reasonably powerful flash .
p3866
aV- Great macro and super macro mode .
p3867
aV- Takes AA batteries and SD cards .
p3868
aVMinuses - Small LCD display , but with some use , you 'll be able to tell if you got a good shot or not .
p3869
aV- I think familiarity with some of the other picture taking modes of the camera is a must -LRB- i.e. aperture and shutter priority modes -RRB- .
p3870
aV- Some purple fringing at high zoom .
p3871
aV- Noise in images , even at low ISOs .
p3872
aV- Some difficulty focusing in low light situations .
p3873
aVI have n't noticed any problems with capturing video to my SD card , like the other reviewer mentioned -LRB- I have a Kingmax platinum card -RRB- .
p3874
aVNor do I think the SD card door is ` flimsy ' .
p3875
aVIt is thin to be sure , but I 've never had a problem with it .
p3876
aVI think color saturation is fine .
p3877
aVColor balance is very natural on normal setting .
p3878
aVVivid color setting produces rich color .
p3879
aVBattery life seems decent to me , I use high capacity NiMH cells .
p3880
aVOverall , this is not a SLR , but you 're not paying the same money either .
p3881
aVOverall , I think this is a decent camera and worth the price .
p3882
aa(lp3883
VI have bought 2 rolls of I-zone sticky film and only one picture has turned out at all .
p3884
aVThe rest are pitch black .
p3885
aVThe one picture was sort of neat of my cat , but other than that I seriously do NOT reccomend this product
p3886
aa(lp3887
VI have lots of cameras , including some very expensive pro models .
p3888
aVHowever , this is the camera I have with me most of the time .
p3889
aVI fits in a pocket , and goes unnoticed until needed .
p3890
aVWith it 's 28mm lens and IS , it just cant ' f be beaten for general use .
p3891
aVIf I was forced to be limited to only one camera , this one would be it .
p3892
aa(lp3893
VThis is the first camcorder I 've owned , though not the first I 've used .
p3894
aVI 'm very happy with my purchase .
p3895
aVI think it has excellent video quality , much better than others in a comparable price range .
p3896
aVIt does have a compact battery -LRB- for a reason -RRB- , and hence a shorter recording time .
p3897
aVI have recorded for over an hour straight with one battery .
p3898
aVBut you can purchase extra batteries if necessary -LRB- I bought one on ebay for $ 20 -RRB- .
p3899
aVIt has tons of features and options , more than I will probably use .
p3900
aVThe manual provided is extremely helpful in guiding you through the many features .
p3901
aVI was recording within 10 minutes of opening the box .
p3902
aVI have read negative reviews regarding the on screen menus , the manual , still images ; let me just say that I have not had any problems with any of those .
p3903
aVI find the menu EASY to navigate .
p3904
aVAnd the manual explains everything .
p3905
aVI read it from front to back without ANY confusion .
p3906
aVIt does not have an index in the back , but it has a table of contents at the beginning if you 'd rather just browse .
p3907
aVI have not seen a CAMCORDER that has better still images than this one .
p3908
aVI have seen better pictures from a digital CAMERA .
p3909
aVI suspect some people may not have the patience , or interest , in learning how to utilize all of the features that may yield the best quality images .
p3910
aVOr , perhaps they 're just used to a different product .
p3911
aVSome of the most commonly used features like playback on TV , downloading to PC , editing , I think are easy to use and just plain fun !
p3912
aVAnyway , I must emphasize that the overall quality of this camcorder is great .
p3913
aVEvery product is different , we pick and choose .
p3914
aVI use mine for recording life 's little -LRB- and big -RRB- events .
p3915
aVIf you 're still comparing camcorders , be sure to consider this one .
p3916
aa(lp3917
VI just got this camera the other day .
p3918
aVAnd so far , I 'm in love with it .
p3919
aVI am a photographer and a video artist , and I had a nicer Sony camera that broke , and I was seeking out a replacement .
p3920
aVThe DCR-HC36 has a much lower quality image than my old camera , however its exactly what i 've been looking for .
p3921
aVSmall , portable , and grainy .
p3922
aVI still would like to get a nicer video camera to replace the old one .
p3923
aVBut I think that this camera is what the Holga is when talking about medium format film cameras .
p3924
aVIt has its charm and you definatly get a certain look to what you record .
p3925
aVThis camera seems like it would be good for someone who just wants to film their kids or family events .
p3926
aVHowever , if you want something with better image quality , spend the money and take a step up .
p3927
aVHowever , i would also recomend this camera for a video production student , its got plenty of manual features and the 20x optical zoom is great .
p3928
aa(lp3929
VReplaced my old Powershot SD790IS which had horrible low light performance and I must say , this camera is wonderful .
p3930
aVLow light pics are amazing for a camera in this size class -- and yet it 's super fast and handles wonderfully .
p3931
aVA few minor quibbles with the control layout but they are minor .
p3932
aVThe build quality is amazing too -- the camera is small yet is so solid and sturdy .
p3933
aVIs ready to take a picture super quick and it can do almost 2fps in burst mode -- continuously .
p3934
aVBiggest gripes : - Mode dial too hard to turn .
p3935
aVIt wo n't get accidentally changed but this is ridiculous .
p3936
aV- Can not assign Movie Record to the shortcut button -LRB- Which you can do on other Canons . -RRB-
p3937
aV- Battery life is a bit short and the battery indicator is inaccurate .
p3938
aVGoes from full charge to no power left very quickly .
p3939
aVThat 's it -- otherwise the camera is a gem .
p3940
aVI highly recommend this if you want to step up to something with more flexibility than your typical point and shoot .
p3941
aVYou wo n't regret it .
p3942
aa(lp3943
V1 .
p3944
aVJust a few qualifying remarks : I like sony products -LRB- F828 , V3 , R1 -RRB- , I 've used many different analog and digital cameras over the years .
p3945
aV2 .
p3946
aVMost folks who are really into photography will agree with my contention that there is no close to perfect camera and there definitely is not one camera that is suited to all tasks .
p3947
aVThus , it 's a reasonable thing to have at least .
p3948
aV.
p3949
aVtwo cameras and certainly unreasonable to expect that one camera will do most things .
p3950
aVThus , whether you 'll like this camera -LRB- ie keep it and use it -RRB- will depend on your specific needs \u005c/ goals for this camera .
p3951
aV3 .
p3952
aVMy impressions after using this for 2-3 months : a. Image Quality : I know that this is going to sound oxymoronic , but this is the worst part of the camera -- -RRB- the images are just ... amateurish looking .
p3953
aVI mean , the really depressing thing is that the JPEGS from the HX5V are overtly worse compared to the Sony V3 JPEGS -LRB- ie a relatively ancient camera with ancient technology -RRB- .
p3954
aVWhat I mean by amateurish is that the colors are overly saturated , the white balance is n't as accurate as a modern camera should be , and the images are overtly contrasty ... and of course , Sony gives the user no option to modify the tone curve .
p3955
aVAll of these things can be somewhat compensated for via Photoshop etc. .
p3956
aV.
p3957
aVbut it 's just an additional step , which really should n't be necessary .
p3958
aVb. Size : It 's pretty small , not as small as some of the other cameras out there , but small enough for most folks -- -RRB- definitely small enough to put in your pocket .
p3959
aVCompared to something like the LX3 , where the lens barrel still protrudes when turned off , this camera is nice and slim when turned off -- -RRB- bottomline , this is the only reason to have this camera -LRB- at least for me -RRB- -- -RRB- a decent quality camera , with various features , in a very compact size .
p3960
aVc. HD movie : This was another selling point for me ; nice quality video in a very small form factor .
p3961
aVd. Most of the other features are just gimmicks , but the one thing that is really cool -LRB- perhaps not of interest to others -RRB- is the panoramic sweep mode .
p3962
aVI 'm into doing a lot of panoramics with my other cameras and I know how tedious it can be .
p3963
aVThus , when you experience the magical ease of just moving this camera from one side to the next -LRB- shooting 10 fps -RRB- and then see the in camera stitched results ; that is some really amazing technology .
p3964
aVFurthermore , the flexibility that Sony allows in the panoramic mode is laudable : ie you can designate whether you want to pan left -- -RRB- right , right -- -RRB- left , up -- -RRB- down , down -- -RRB- up .
p3965
aVEven more amazing is that since this camera has a compass or some type of gyroscope , it is able to determine at what angle you 're shooting the panorama at and thus compensate for it -- -RRB- giving you a corrected horizontal panorama -LRB- those of you who shoot panoramas know what I 'm talking about -RRB- .
p3966
aVThe downside as noted above comes down to the image quality -- -RRB- the JPEGs are just so-so .
p3967
aVFurthermore , you have no control over ISO , shutter speed etc. .
p3968
aV.
p3969
aVIt 's all pretty much automated in that sense .
p3970
aVWhat I 'm really looking forward to -LRB- most likely way down the road -RRB- is when Sony implements this panoramic sweep technology into their SLR line or Mirrorless line , with the ability to shoot RAW and with different lens .
p3971
aVWith the HX5 , you can only shoot panos at the 24mm equivalent focal length .
p3972
aVNonetheless , there are certain shooting situations in which I can get really unique and interesting panos with this camera which I would n't be able to get with my regular more sophisticated gear .
p3973
aV4 .
p3974
aVThus , if you need a small \u005c/ compact , nicely designed camera with a nice feature set -LRB- nice focal length range , cool panorama mode , HD video , along with ability to take ... decent snapshots -RRB- to carry around during those times when lugging around a bigger camera is going to be a pain in the butt ; this is definitely a camera to consider .
p3975
aVJust be aware of the pros \u005c/ cons .
p3976
aa(lp3977
VMy daughter 's favorite color is purple ... I got this camera for her to take to camp because they ca n't take their phones with them .
p3978
aVShe really loves it !
p3979
aVTakes great pictures and having the little case for it is really great !
p3980
aV-LRB- her last camera did n't have a case , and it got ruined being carried in her purse -RRB- I would definitely recommend this camera !
p3981
aa(lp3982
VI have being contemplating jumping into the semi-pro\u005c/pro body realm since I outgrew my D40x a year ago , but the prices have been unrealistically high .
p3983
aVThe D200 , though using nearly 4-year old technology , has been a staple for many Nikonians until the D300 was release in 2007 ; but I never felt that the enhanced AF abilities and ISO capabilities were justifying the extraordinary $ 1699 price tag of the D300 versus the D200 !
p3984
aVSo I made the jump when a price drop happened , got the D200 for $ 599 NEW from a competitor online .
p3985
aVYou ca n't compare the processing speed or 3D AF of the D300 to the D200 , completely blow the socks off of this nearly 4 year old body .
p3986
aVBut if you are a beginner like me and would like a semi-pro\u005c/pro body that has ALL of the functions and customizations you could ever think of , this is your time to jump in on a discontinued body .
p3987
aVYou could get a D90 for $ 300 more , but that will soon be outdated by the D400 , and after testing out the D5000 , I am sure the next in this semi-pro\u005c/pro series will be AWESOME ; however , are you willing to pay the premium for new technology ?
p3988
aVIn short , CONS : The D200 is n't usable without a flash above ISO 1000 -LRB- maybe 1250 -RRB- The viewfinder is n't 100 % Theere are n't dual CF slots PROS : At the current prices , this slaughters the D90\u005c/D40\u005c/D60 series for ability to have ALL controls at hand , infinite customization , exapansive information in the viewfinder , unparalleled weather sealing , and backward compatibility to lenses dating to the 1960 's .
p3989
aVLooks cooler than the other D90\u005c/D40\u005c/D60 series in size , weight , grip , and dimension All in all , this body will teach you how to be an excellent photographer and show you your flaws faster than the newer non pro-models ever could .
p3990
aVHappy shooting !
p3991
aa(lp3992
VExactly 1 year and 1 month after purchasing this camera , the flash stopped working .
p3993
aVThe warranty expires after one year , so I took the camera in to a local shop .
p3994
aVThey said that the problem was in the CPU of the camera and they would have to send the camera back to Olympus .
p3995
aV Fine , except Olypus charges $ 250 to fix the camera !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u000aNN NNP , IN NN NNS $ CD TO VB DT NN NN\u000a Fine , except olypus charge $ 250 to fix the camera !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000a\u000a Can you believe it !??!?!\u000aJJ MD PRP VB PRP IN\u000a can you believe it !??!?!\u000a\u000a\u000aI 'm OUTRAGED !\u000aPRP VBP JJ .\u000aI be outraged !\u000a\u000a

p3997
aVI 'm OUTRAGED !
p3998
aa(lp3999
VWell , I just like the camera .
p4000
aVIt 's got excellent looks .
p4001
aVIt 's really compact and has great features .
p4002
aa(lp4003
VThe camera is superb .
p4004
aVWorks better than any other camera that I have used .
p4005
aVThe infrared feature works great in complete darkness .
p4006
aVI have it sending motion alerts to my Iphone .
p4007
aa(lp4008
VFor the price , this camera is everything and more .
p4009
aVFunctionality , features and print quality are right up there with higher end cameras ... do not compare this to those though , because it 's not , but I 'd say close .
p4010
aVFor me , who enjoys photography , and was a bit behind technology with my old Olympus , it 's great .
p4011
aVI was impressed with the movie shooting ability ... I 'm actually using it to convert some old 8mm home movies , and it 's pretty good too .
p4012
aVJust be sure to get at least a 4GB card if you plan on doing movies .
p4013
aVThe microphone is also excellent in the sound quality for this point and shoot .
p4014
aVI also like to experiment with exposure settings , indoor\u005c/outdoor etc. and this camera will keep me busy in that area for sure .
p4015
aVGiant LCD screen also makes it easy to size up your photo .
p4016
aVNo viewfinder .
p4017
aVSo long story short , if you want a camera that can take pictures right out of the box , or do amateur\u005c/pro work with ease , here 's an excellent camera .
p4018
aa(lp4019
VIn a two-year span I have done three important projects that went to DVD and maybe five family home videos .
p4020
aVI 'm getting pretty good at using manual settings to get rich colors and high quality shots .
p4021
aVBut lately , as I watch the video from the last two projects I am noticing a couple of dead pixels , tiny white spots that are always there .
p4022
aVThey are especially noticeable when you zoom in on someone 's face .
p4023
aVSo on the next project I borrowed a GL2 from my friend to avoid having this flaw in my shots , but his camera is about the same age and it also has this problem .
p4024
aVI called Canon to see what it might be , and it turns out that it is something wrong with the CCD and prism system .
p4025
aVThe Part is $ 500.00 and the labor starts at $ 400.00 .
p4026
aVIn other words , its is not worth fixing .
p4027
aVSo I consider the GL2 a throw away piece of junk after about a year and a half .
p4028
aa(lp4029
VSince I could see it , I wanted it !
p4030
aVI has a cybershot p75 , but I break down it in an accident .
p4031
aVI spend time to looking for the best camera for people who want to learn more about photography .
p4032
aVI compared between Canon and Sony , and I was some undecided , but the reviews was help me so much .
p4033
aVFinally I bought DSC-H1 and I have began to take pictures specially by the night .
p4034
aa(lp4035
VI wanted a camera that I could slip into my front pocket and not feel as though it was there - the Sony 350 does this .
p4036
aVI wanted clear quality pics capturing all the quality of colors - the Sony 350 does this .
p4037
aVI have three large Canon digital cameras which cost in the thousands dollars .
p4038
aVThey work great - but they can not fit in my pocket - and I was seeking a small but high quality camera .
p4039
aVI spent a year talking with others who had large digital cameras asking them if they owned a smaller pocket one - the overall answer was a Cybershot .
p4040
aVDid n't really matter which model they owned , they were all very satisfied with the Cybershot .
p4041
aVThe Cybershot 's lenses is made by a German engineering firm .
p4042
aVNo other pocket size camera has such quality .
p4043
aVSo the question for me was which model , and that took four months of debate .
p4044
aVI am satisfied with the Sony DSC-W350 ; I would purchase it again .
p4045
aVIt actually has more features -LRB- shot , video , etc -RRB- than I was seeking , and I may never use the video feature since I am primarily a still photo shooter .
p4046
aVI will chat about the camera below , but just want to say three quick things if you decide to purchase this camera .
p4047
aVIt initially needs 8 hours for a full charge on the battery .
p4048
aVThe internal memory is very small - spend the money for a larger size memory .
p4049
aVI purchased 8 GB - which I had purchased 16 GB since on a trip there is n't always the ability to download the pics to a laptop or computer .
p4050
aVIf you are good with figuring out electronics -LRB- or owned a digital camera before - the six page book and your ability are sufficient to launch right off into a trip -RRB- .
p4051
aVIf you need more info - you will have to load the disc for the full manual .
p4052
aVI left on a trip two days after the camera arrived and was able to operate it fine without the full manual , but when I returned I dug into the manual for answers to all my many questions .
p4053
aVI was going to purchase the Cybershot via Costco -LRB- yes , between Costco and Amazon it constitutes 96 % of our household purchases - we have even purchased lawn mowers via Amazon -RRB- .
p4054
aVBut , with not having to pay the sales tax on Amazon I was able to take these monies and use them toward an 8 GB memory .
p4055
aVThis is n't a major negative , yet I want to mention it .
p4056
aVThe standard digital -LRB- larger quality cameras -RRB- can take a pic directly into the sun .
p4057
aVThere are times when you have no choice to move around - such as on a ship , or other confined areas .
p4058
aVThe sun washes out any view you have in the viewfinder with the Sony 350 .
p4059
aVNone of the Cybershots can do this .
p4060
aVAnd , from my research I did not learn of any pocket cameras that could .
p4061
aVAgain , one can not have everything in a pocket size camera .
p4062
aVIt is n't a major issue , but if one is use to taking pics into the sun -LRB- if you own a larger quality camera -RRB- do n't be disappointed when you can not with the Cybershot .
p4063
aVWith my larger Canon cameras I very rarely use a flash in dim lighting and due to the camera 's ability the pics are great .
p4064
aVThe Sony 350 does not have the ability to take pictures in the no flash setting and capture quality pics with dim light .
p4065
aVOne can not have everything though with a camera that can slip into your pocket .
p4066
aV-LRB- The Sony 350 has an fast button for clicking flash on and off . -RRB-
p4067
aVWhen I go on trip -LRB- though age 63 -RRB- I still make the trip an adventure as though I was in college .
p4068
aVI also run full and half marathons .
p4069
aVI wanted a camera that I could take with me when on occasions a larger camera would n't work .
p4070
aVThe Sony arrived one day before I left for the NYC Half Marathon .
p4071
aVI purchased the Sony 350 to carry with me on the this run .
p4072
aVYes , it is that small , it can fit in your fist .
p4073
aVIt was covered with sweat but still took great pics and had no problem later with the sweat being on the camera , and the camera working fine .
p4074
aVThe camera was passed around to others running in my group so we all part took in enjoying pics of each other .
p4075
aVI could n't have done that with one of my larger cameras .
p4076
aVI took the Cybershot -LRB- along with a Canon -RRB- with me on a camping trip to Alaska in the early Spring - still below freezing with snow everywhere .
p4077
aVI gave the Sony 350 to the other person , and they had a blast taking pictures on their own .
p4078
aVThe other person has never owned a camera yet still took great pics - that 's the quality of this camera .
p4079
aVWe camped at the base camp of Mt. Mc Kinley -LRB- or Denali -RRB- and the Sony was in the snow often - never bothered the camera 's ability to continue to operate .
p4080
aVI now leave the Sony 350 in my car so it is readily accessible .
p4081
aVIt is so small it can easily be kept in many locations not visible to a person looking in the car .
p4082
aVThere have been many times over the many years I wish I had a camera with me to take pics when I had not planned on doing so .
p4083
aVOh , I have a camera on my cell , but the quality -LRB- as we all know -RRB- is limited .
p4084
aVThe Sony 350 is small and captures the pics I want .
p4085
aVI will always take the Sony 350 with me on trips , along with my larger Canon cameras .
p4086
aVI can keep the Sony 350 in my pocket at all times , and capture many candid pics that I could n't have done with the Canon since everyone would know I was in the picture taking mood with a larger camera .
p4087
aVThe Sony is also very easy to use , and folks will now say - let me take a pic of you .
p4088
aVThey wo n't do that with my larger cameras - they were too intimidated by the larger camera -LRB- full of buttons and switches on the Canons -RRB- .
p4089
aVI would purchase the Cybershot again .
p4090
aVMy only regret is I should have purchased it a year earlier to have part take in the fun of having a pocket size camera .
p4091
aa(lp4092
VThis camera seems to be good quality , but I am having problems setting it up .
p4093
aVI am trying to hook it up to an IMac and it works when plugged in , but I want to use it wirelessly and when I unplug it the connection is lost .
p4094
aVI am following the directions in the Mac setup book .
p4095
aVIt will ask me for a `` Share Key '' .
p4096
aVDoes anybody know what a share key is ?
p4097
aVIt also tells me to look in the user manual , which did not come with my camera .
p4098
aa(lp4099
VIf you love too much travel like I do and you are looking for a big camera but you do not like the size , this is the camera that you need .
p4100
aVYou can take the manual control of this camera and the intelligent function is also really good .
p4101
aVBe CAREFUL with the battery , it is not easy to find and it is expensive .
p4102
aVThe delivery was really good .
p4103
aa(lp4104
VI am currently using this camera to make a documentary with a friend and it is serving our needs quite well .
p4105
aVThe ditigal tapes can be transferred to 16 mm film for a minor expense compared to filming and editing with 16mm .
p4106
aVThis will be a revolution for anyone wanting to do film projects !
p4107
aa(lp4108
VA great , reasonably priced camera that is intuitive to operate and produces high-quality images .
p4109
aVBought this for my mom as a birthday present , and she has n't been able to put it down .

VPurchased the SL 980 Sealife Video Light last year prior to a Tahiti diving trip in March .
p4113
aVThe light worked once at about 60 feet for a minute of filming .
p4114
aVTurned light off until I wanted to use it again and the light would not turn back on .
p4115
aVOnce back in the boat and after removing and reinstalling battery compartment the light worked again .
p4116
aVSame thing happend on the next dive .
p4117
aVReceived a replacement Video light once I returned from the trip .
p4118
aVTook my next dive trip to the Caribbean this February with the new light and the same thing happened again .
p4119
aVLight worked one time while down under pressure up to 70 feet then would not turn back on when needed .
p4120
aVOnce back in the boat and battery case removed and reinstalled the light did turn on but could not be turned back off .
p4121
aVAfter a couple of days the light worked properly again .
p4122
aVSoooo Disappointing !!!
p4123
aVNow I have send back this light and wait for a replacement .
p4124
aVThere never seems to be an answer as to why this is happening and since I live in Colorado there is no way to test the new one prior to going on my next annual trip .
p4125
aa(lp4126
VI decided to give this camera a try after all the positive reviews I have seen not only in Amazon , but CNET , Simon , etc. .
p4127
aVI did a lot of research .
p4128
aVI wanted to buy a SLR camera but at the same time I did not want to break the bank .
p4129
aVThe camera came and just out of the box and could not take a decent picture .
p4130
aVImages came grainy and blurry .
p4131
aVI asked in here several times about shutter lag .
p4132
aVSome of the other users do not seem to experience any problems with it .
p4133
aVI took some pictures of my very active two year old .
p4134
aVThe only thing that I got was ghostly images of a kid running away completely out of focus .
p4135
aVSo I learn my lesson there is not short cuts I will spend the extra $ 300 - $ 400 for an entry level SLR instead .
p4136
aVI took the camera to best buy two days after the purchase .
p4137
aVMaybe I got a bad one because my experience does not correlate with all the great reviews that I have seen from previous owners .
p4138
aa(lp4139
VI bought this camera a little over a year ago and I have only had problems .
p4140
aVFirst of all there is a very loud hissing noise from the gears that you can hear noticeably on tape .
p4141
aVSo I called Samsung in hopes that this was a common problem with a quick answer , and they said that they could fix it -LRB- which is n't cheap -RRB- or I could just exchange it for another .
p4142
aVSo I exchanged it for another and I had the same problem and I decided to live with it .
p4143
aVThere are more problems as well , for one the usb connection is miserable .
p4144
aVThe quality and clarity of the video using usb is as good as most digital camera videos .
p4145
aVHowever the firewire works very well with reasonable quality .
p4146
aVThe audio on the tape is fair besides the annoying hissing .
p4147
aVAlthough if you plan to use an external mic .
p4148
aVto eliminate mechanical noises it only plays back through one speaker .
p4149
aVMost recently I have had problems that the pixels on the camera are distorted and now there 's a green line that does n't show on the LCD screen but everywhere else .
p4150
aVNo , this is not a tape problem because I have tried other brands of tapes and when I feed the video directly to my TV .
p4151
aVor computer it 's still there .
p4152
aVOverall do not expect good quality from this camcorder but if you really do n't mind the hissing or you wo n't be editing videos on your computer you might want to buy this .
p4153
aa(lp4154
VThis is my 2nd digital camera , first one wore out .
p4155
aVI read and read reviews on several cameras in this category and this price range then narrowed it down to 2 , Canon Powershot SD1300IS and the Nikon Coolpix S3000 .
p4156
aVDecided on the Canon , very happy with my camera , still learning all that it can do .
p4157
aVLiked that it came with a free picture card , also glad that I do n't have to buy anymore batteries , the charger with the battery is great .
p4158
aVGlad the av cable came with the camera as well , Nikon did not offer that with the S3000 .
p4159
aVWill do an update after I take more pictures and learn more things about this nifty little camera .
p4160
aa(lp4161
VIt says sold by Target and by Amazon .
p4162
aVthis one misleads customers , shows another model that has an lcd display on the back , and the one sold does not .
p4163
aVIt says 2.1 MegaPixels and the one you received it 's 0.1 .
p4164
aVThis camera is for a kid -LRB- not more than 5 years old -RRB- .
p4165
aVIt 's a piece of crap !
p4166
aVSo disapointed with this buy .
p4167
aVOn the packing it does n't says 2.1 MP , so I wonder were this info came from .
p4168
aVA cellphone has better resolution than this junk .
p4169
aVDo n't be mislead , I recommend do n't buy this product , you 'll throw away your money .
p4170
aa(lp4171
VThis was my first DSLR .
p4172
aVI have been using older manual 35mm SLRs which really is a good background .
p4173
aVOverall I am really happy with it .
p4174
aVSome comments : - If you 're looking at the D50 with the 18-50mm lens , really consider the D70 kit with the 18-70mm lens .
p4175
aVI was going to get the D50 body only and buy this lens but the kit price of this package with this lens made it a no brainer .
p4176
aVThe 18-70mm lens is built better and I found I really needed the 70mm end of the lens often , plus having a much bigger zoom range without changing lenses .
p4177
aVBut also watch out becuase on the 35mm end there is a little barrel distortion on the edges of the pictures .
p4178
aV-LRB- pretty minor though -RRB- - The camera is extremely intuitive .
p4179
aVI bought this camera right before I went to Burning Man and had snapped about 300 frames before I really dug into the manual .
p4180
aVThere are many many options in the menus that are pretty much self-explanatory .
p4181
aV- The battery life is phenomenal .
p4182
aVI have a 1GB hi-speed CF card , and I can fill it up almost twice before running out of battery -LRB- about 700 pictures with occasional flash use -RRB- My only complaints are minor : - The slight distortion on the wide angle - The viewfider is a litle small -LRB- although I have good eyesight and it has n't been an issue -RRB- - I wish the LCD screen was a little bigger .
p4183
aV- USB 2 would be nice , but for how seldom I have to dump pictures -LRB- I get about 500 on a card -RRB- it 's not a big deal .
p4184
aVYou can just buy a CF reader and a 2nd card .
p4185
aV- Avoid the 1600 ISO setting unless you really really need it .
p4186
aVIt gets pretty grainy .
p4187
aa(lp4188
VI just got this camera and i must say its awesome !
p4189
aVNow please understand there are MUCH better cameras out there , but they cost MUCH more .
p4190
aVBAD 1 .
p4191
aVNo zoom 2 .
p4192
aVIt can be little difficult to get going software wise .
p4193
aVGood 1 .
p4194
aVImage is really good for the money 2 .
p4195
aVWorks with android phones with no problems !
p4196
aV-LRB- with others too im sure -RRB- 3 .
p4197
aVshipped with everything you need !!
p4198
aVAll and all this is a great camera for the price !
p4199
aVI am more then sure for the normal everyday person\u005c/business owner this will be more then affective .
p4200
aVI am using this for home security and it great !
p4201
aVand with the pan and tilt i only need 2 cameras to do all the areas i need !
p4202
aa(lp4203
VI videotape a good amount of sporting events for our town ... namely Football for the most part .
p4204
aVWhen I had to sell my Sony CCD-TRV66 Hi-8 Camcorder a couple of years ago due to financial difficulty , I never thought I 'd find another Hi-8 cam like that one !
p4205
aVWhen things picked up for us a bit , I decided on this one ... The Samsung SC-L906 .
p4206
aVIt is superb !
p4207
aVNow I suspect that the co. took an old Canon model and applied some of their own thought to it as the styling and features bespeak Canon in many ways .
p4208
aVI have owned numerous cams over the years so I know what I am talking about !
p4209
aVThe 2.5 '' LCD is great but direct sunlight may force one to use the B Viewfinder instead .
p4210
aVThe large `` Easy Q '' button on the side of the camcorder makes for great instant setup enabling the novice to experience great success !
p4211
aVAs one becomes more familiar with the unit ... the `` Customized Settings '' button will obviously become attractive .
p4212
aVSpeaking of which there are some wonderful `` Special Effects '' such as Canon 's famed `` Mirror Image '' which is wild to say the least !
p4213
aVBattery Power is superb given the supplied Lithium-Ion battery lasts for two hours max .
p4214
aVOf course if you are going to constantly use the LCD while engaging the very bright built-in light , this will drain the battery even faster !
p4215
aVExtra batteries are the cheapest on the market for the Samsungs !
p4216
aVOh by the way , indoor pictures with the built-in light are just fine !
p4217
aVPeople have to realize that the doggone thing is not designed to fill a large dark room .
p4218
aVIn that instance you will require professional lighting .
p4219
aVWhat I do not like about the camcorder is its somewhat awkward `` Zoom Control '' which is a small spring-like dial that operates from side to side as opposed to the older `` rocker '' type .
p4220
aVDo n't worry , just loosen the hand strap a bit and you 'll experience little difficulty .
p4221
aVAlso , at times the `` Auto-Focus '' feature can be just a wee bit sluggish under low light conditions but is ok overall .
p4222
aVThe fact that it 's mono and not stereo bothers me also but I will say that the mono audio quality is first rate as the built-in MIC is very wide range with good deep bass compared to my old Sony 66 .
p4223
aVThe Mini-plug A\u005c/V patch can cause problems when viewing on older A\u005c/V monitors but on newer sets like the Toshibas ... it is just great !
p4224
aVMake sure you purchase an inexpensive 37mm UV Filter for this camcorder as it will cut down on annoying rays and filter through most humidity .
p4225
aVIt will also protect the Samsung 's first rate Main Lens .
p4226
aVEven with this filter permanently attatched , you 'll still be able to snap on the Samsung 's Lens Cap for protection while not in use .
p4227
aVAnother nice add-on for this camera is Amazon 's very low priced 37mm Sunpak Circular Polarizer that will clear up situations where you are forced to film action slightly toward the sun !
p4228
aVAll-in-all , if you want a great camcorder at a really low price that operates quietly and smoothly as a newborn baby 's pitoot ... this is your cam !
p4229
aVUse quality Samsung Hi-8 tape which I suspect is actually Maxell XR .
p4230
aVYou wo n't believe the low price of the stuff !
p4231
aVThe sharp colorful detailed pictures are most convincing although a bit of grain will be detected in low-light situations .
p4232
aVThe `` Field Of Depth '' is surprisingly good for this model !
p4233
aVThe Samsung SC-L906 is a superb Hi-8 camcorder that should last for years !
p4234
aa(lp4235
VI decided a lot before buying this camera , the tie was between cannon S2 IS and Sony DSC-H1 .
p4236
aVI finally decided to go for DSC-H1 This is an absolutly great camera , the 12x zoom rocks .
p4237
aVThe image stabilization is also awesome .
p4238
aVThe only con is that , it has a very bright flash which throws up a lot of artificial light on the subject .
p4239
aVThe battery life -LRB- sony -RRB- is also good .
p4240
aVBut Cannon S2 uses the SD card which has become very cheap , where as H1 uses the memory stick which is costlier when comepared to SD .
p4241
aVoverall the DSC-H1 is a great camera , but i would rather recommend going for a digital SLR if you are on the passion side of photography , since DSLR 's prices are tumbling down .
p4242
aa(lp4243
VAfter borrowing this camera from my daughter , decided to buy one for myself .
p4244
aVthis is an easy to use camera and easy to hook up to your computer when you get back from vacation to review the videos that you took .
p4245
aa(lp4246
VI am sorely disappointed with this camcorder .
p4247
aVIts lighting is not only poor - its erratic !!
p4248
aVSometimes at whatever angle I record , even in bright light , the resulting picture has unpredictable dark and bright lighting .
p4249
aVThis camera is just not worth it .
p4250
aVThe rewind and forward operations are plain frustrating .
p4251
aVJVC wins hands down anyday !
p4252
aa(lp4253
VPurchased this item from a local retailer .
p4254
aVI had some expectations based purely on the Sony brand .
p4255
aVI really was not expecting too much given that this camcorder is on the low end of the market .
p4256
aVI took it home and did a side-by-side comparison with a 3 year old Canon Powershot point-and-shoot camera in video mode , and a 2-1\u005c/2 year old Aiptek 720HD flash video recorder .
p4257
aVThe Sony DCR-SX44 was by far the worse performing .
p4258
aVConsidering that the Sony only had to beat out a 3 year old camera and 2 + year old low-end video recorder , both of which were in the same price range when purchased , I was disappointed with its performance .
p4259
aVI recorded with them all in the same setting -- low light indoor environment .
p4260
aVThe canon and aiptek produced relatively sharp video .
p4261
aVThe Sony produced a blurry video , way below acceptable threshold for me .
p4262
aVThe Sony did record the best audio , and the image stabilization seemed good to me .
p4263
aVI tested the playback on a small screen , a window on a pc monitor , so that the test would not unfairly bias the results in favor of the higher definition of the other recorders .
p4264
aVStill , even on a small screen , the Sony image quality was by far the worst .
p4265
aVIn general , I still like many Sony products , and this wo n't stop me from trying other products from them .
p4266
aa(lp4267
VI have had this camera for about 7 months now and i think it is a great camera .
p4268
aVIt does have its limitations .
p4269
aVLow light situations are not the greatest , but acceptable .
p4270
aVThe photo function is only like 1 megapixel or less , but i did ' t buy for the photo quality .
p4271
aV-LRB- You want sharp photos get a digital camera ! -RRB-
p4272
aVIn a well light situation the video quality is supurb and editing the video in the computer is awesome !
p4273
aVHighly Recommended !
p4274
aVGood Value for the money !
p4275
aVWho needs a bigger lcd !
p4276
aVIf the video is sharp , clear and i can get it into the computer i am happy !
p4277
aa(lp4278
VLumix has long been a favorite camera for me .
p4279
aVThis one has new features I enjoy but much of it is still beyond me .
p4280
aVI get beautiful photos but do n't yet take advantage of all it offers .
p4281
aVGreat photos even with my limited understanding .
p4282
aa(lp4283
VI am really am enjoying my new camera !
p4284
aVIt is the best equipment i have taken photos with .
p4285
aVIt is easy to use - just enough camera to use as an amateur , but alot more for taking it to the next level !
p4286
aVI am very pleased with my purchase .
p4287
aVAmazon was fast , efficient , and bought with much confidence !
p4288
aVthanks .
p4289
aa(lp4290
VWhile the Celestron 8SE is an easy telescope to set up , and moderately easy to use the company customer service leaves much to be desired .
p4291
aVThe scope I received lasted 3 days before the hand controller failed .
p4292
aVAfter never receiving any email responses to web requests for customer service I called .
p4293
aVthey agreed that the hand controller failed -LRB- I saw many discussions of this on the web -RRB- .
p4294
aVThey wanted me to send it in as well as the rest of the mount .
p4295
aVI paid more than $ 100 to overnight the unit to Celestron and after 5 days of silence I called and they said it was their policy to have a 30 day repair time for warranty .
p4296
aVSeveral email queries to status havegone unanswered .
p4297
aVThe customer service and turnaround times for repairs under warranty are excessive and the company has no sense of urgency that you spent thousands and are sitting with a useless piece of equipment after 1 week of use .
p4298
aa(lp4299
VI am an intermediate user with a lot of film experience .
p4300
aVI grew up on a fully manual Minolta -LRB- still love this camera -RRB- but I never purchased a DSLR .
p4301
aVI made the jump to the D7000 and I am very happy .
p4302
aVLearning to use the D7000 has improved my understanding of all of the extra features on my Canon Powershot S95 -LRB- another great camera . -RRB-
p4303
aVJumping to the bottom line , I love the features .
p4304
aVI ultimately selected this model for the dual memory card slots .
p4305
aVThe programmable user settings give you what amounts to three different manual configurations .
p4306
aVThe VR lenses are very impressive -LRB- I am no longer a skeptic . -RRB-
p4307
aVI got the camera about a week ago and already have my personal settings configured and one user setting programmed .
p4308
aVThis may not sound like a big deal but it is when you want to try out the differences and effect of some relatively minor adjustments .
p4309
aVI agree with a lot of the other reviewers that the camera does seam to overexpose .
p4310
aVI find myself going a little below the meter a lot and setting up the bracket for -1 EV .
p4311
aVI am still experimenting with the video but my first impression is that this camera will never replace my Sony HDR-SR11 but it is nice to be able to toggle back and forth .
p4312
aVThe auto-focus is clearly audible in playback .
p4313
aVThe focus tracking works but you will probably turn it off for sensitive recording .
p4314
aVThe pictures are great .
p4315
aVI think before going up to 24mp I would look into better glass in front of the sensor .
p4316
aVThe camera is a little big for my 7 year old but she is still able to use it and make great photos .
p4317
aVExactly what I was looking for .
p4318
aa(lp4319
VIf you ca n't afford the 7D buy this camera .
p4320
aVIt 's simply excellent .
p4321
aVOnly complaint is that it does n't output hdmi to 1080 .
p4322
aVThe 7D does .
p4323
aa(lp4324
VI purchased this camera to be an upgrade over smartphone cameras and it has n't disappointed .
p4325
aVI have not used the panorama or video modes but for straight photos this camera works very well , power on time is quick , picture quality is quite good even with zoom and the included software works well .
p4326
aa(lp4327
VI own both the S90 and S95 -LRB- G10 and G11 also , as well as F-1 and numerous Nikons including the D90 -RRB- .
p4328
aVHands down , I took more photos on a daily basis with the S90 since I took it EVERYWHERE .
p4329
aVAs they say , the absolute best camera is the one you have when you need to take a photograph .
p4330
aVThe picture quality of the S90 is superb and the S95 is at least as good .
p4331
aVOften the biggest limiter to picture quality is the skill of the photographer .
p4332
aVTime spent mastering a particular camera is well spent and paper specs often can mislead .
p4333
aVDiscussing subtle nuances over comparable cameras is often more academic than practical .
p4334
aVThe S95 gives the serious photographer tremendous flexibility from full auto to full manual and superb features that are packaged in a truly pocketable high performing camera that is arguably best in class .
p4335
aVSo what has improved : Body finish ... more tactile and grippy Selection wheel on back has click stops ... hurray !
p4336
aVOn\u005c/off button is where it should be .
p4337
aV720p movie mode added -LRB- 24 fps vs 30 for lx5 -RRB- with stereo recording .
p4338
aVMore scenes including High Dynamic Range -LRB- very cool -RRB- Numerous technical innovations that result in more stable , sharper pictures .
p4339
aVButton feel on back is more positive .
p4340
aVRing on front has more friction and feels more positive .
p4341
aVBody even smaller and more pocketable .
p4342
aVMenu system updated but if you can drive a S90 , G10 or G11 you will be off and running .
p4343
aVImproved hand lanyard placement .
p4344
aVImproved shutter release .
p4345
aVSlightly rounded corners ... looks feels better .
p4346
aVWhat stayed the same : Battery door and card slot .
p4347
aVSame cables and connectors .
p4348
aVLack of grip ... no denying it would add weight but ... Build quality ... as good as it will get .
p4349
aVWhat got worse : This part is highly subjective because different people see the same change differently -LRB- I see the size reduction as good , while others have said it 's bad ... so be wary and know if you agree with peoples reasons -RRB- .
p4350
aVThumb rest no longer there ... I missed it .
p4351
aVSo there you have my first impressions and if I had to choose between the S90 and S95 , the S95 is the clear winner !
p4352
aa(lp4353
VMy husband has been looking for `` the '' right camera to finally go digital and this was the one !
p4354
aVSo , far he is extremely happy with it and impressed with everything that it can do .
p4355
aa(lp4356
VThe deal breaker : This camera does not have the ability to turn off the quick view .
p4357
aVWhen I am taking pictures I do n't always want to see each and every photo after each and every shot .
p4358
aVThat is what the review button is for .
p4359
aVI can take several photos and delete what I did not like !
p4360
aVI do n't like the feel of the camera .
p4361
aVIt is awkward .
p4362
aVMy hands fold all over the camera and my fingers have to bend in uncomfortable moves just to focus and then to press the shutter button !
p4363
aVIt is `` noisy '' .
p4364
aVI do n't mean that the neighbors can hear you take a photo but all that grinding noise is annoying !
p4365
aVMy P850 does not make even half that noise !
p4366
aVI will say the camera takes some nice outdoor shots ... indoors , no. .
p4367
aVI could `` get used '' to this camera in the operation sense but for this much money , I should not have to .
p4368
aVMy P850 was much heavier yet there was so little awkwardness in the feel that I did not notice the heft .
p4369
aVWhereas this camera while lighter is just carpal tunnel waiting to set in !
p4370
aVThis camera is going back today !
p4371
aVIt is too bad .
p4372
aVI really had high hopes for it .
p4373
aVI really used to love the Kodak name .
p4374
aVIt meant quality .
p4375
aVIt meant value .
p4376
aVNow it just means `` cheap '' throw something together !
p4377
aa(lp4378
VI love this camera .
p4379
aVNot only does it take amazing pictures , but it does n't take long to learn how to use .
p4380
aVThe camera is great for people who do n't know a whole lot about camera setting and also great for those who know how to set shutter rates and other various more advanced settings .
p4381
aVA great buy .
p4382
aa(lp4383
VAfter two weeks of use the device no longer charges .
p4384
aVI 've tried different batteries and different chargers with the same result .
p4385
aVFollow up : I sent it back for repairs .
p4386
aVThe repaired unit broke after a month .
p4387
aa(lp4388
VIt 's a really good camera for the price , I got it for $ 300 with the card .
p4389
aVThis camera does alright in the the dark but its really made for good bright sunny days - that 's where its best HD comes in .
p4390
aVAs for regular or cloudy days , it is great as well .
p4391
aVOnly had it for a month and I already made some YouTube videos .
p4392
aVAs for video software , if you do not have a Mac -LRB- easiest way to upload\u005c/edit your videos with -RRB- , i recommend buying AVS Video Editor .
p4393
aVIt 's great .
p4394
aVThere is a free downloadable version online if you want to check it out , however with this free version when you publish , or finish your movie , it says it is `` not valid '' and then you get these dumb words in the middle of the screen .
p4395
aVDid that a few times before coughing up $ 50 + dollars on the software .
p4396
aVOh well , I like editing movies .
p4397
aVSnowboarding season is here , holidays , my current college life , all of next summer and more will be captured on this camera .
p4398
aVOverall , great product .
p4399
aa(lp4400
VThis camera dissappoints in many ways .
p4401
aVI even wonder if Panasonic had photographers to test this camera .
p4402
aVFor example , you ca n't have `` slow synch flash '' without the amateurish and annoying `` red-eye reduction '' on at the same time .
p4403
aVThe low-light quality is still poor - very poor considering this camera boasts a larger sensor and considerably higher price .
p4404
aVThe white case is pretty in pictures , but feels like cheap plastic in the hand .
p4405
aVHonestly , I should have known better .
p4406
aVI only have one other Panasonic product - a Blu-Ray player .
p4407
aVIt is likewise a very poor product .
p4408
aVAvoid this brand .
p4409
aa(lp4410
VThe HV10 produces some great video .
p4411
aVFits my hand well and is easy to use .
p4412
aVIt uses the older DV tapes , but still has great video quality .
p4413
aa(lp4414
VPros : Seriously fast .
p4415
aVExcellent picture quality .
p4416
aVWell weighted , feels great in your hands .
p4417
aVMenus and user interface intuitive .
p4418
aVCons : Issue with built-in flash being permanently disabled after using an external flash .
p4419
aVIt does n't matter if you remove the external flash or not , the built-in will not function .
p4420
aVThis is a known issue and can be fixed by Canon .
p4421
aVI upgraded from a Canon Rebel XTi to this camera .
p4422
aVThe difference , obviously , is major .
p4423
aVI really wanted to move up to a 5D Mk II , however , the price just was n't justifiable to me .
p4424
aVThe 7D did not seem to have any additional features that I required so I made the decision on the 60D .
p4425
aVI am absolutely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this camera to just about anyone .
p4426
aVBeginners keep in mind there will be a learning curve associated with this camera , however , it is n't any more than any other product on the market .
p4427
aa(lp4428
VAmazing camera .
p4429
aVI 'm not pro on these DSLR 's but it 's not so hard to understand how things work .
p4430
aV60D is my first DSLR and I 'm so happy to have it
p4431
aa(lp4432
VMy old Kodak Easyshare Z760 finally bit the dust after many years of loyal service and I was excited to buy another camera .
p4433
aVI did my research -- consumer reports rated this product as a best buy and I found that several private individuals rated it very good as well .
p4434
aVI am not a professional photographer -- just a grandma that likes to take LOTS of pictures of her fast-moving 3 year old granddaughter !
p4435
aVAnd that was the first problem I encountered .
p4436
aVIn half of my photos she is a blur .
p4437
aVThe background is clear , but she is n't .
p4438
aVIf she is sitting still , I can get a great picture .
p4439
aVBut if she so much as moves a hand , then that hand is a blur .
p4440
aVThe second issue has to do with processing speed .
p4441
aVI frequently like to take several pictures in a row -- click , click , click .
p4442
aVMy old Kodak could do that , but my new powershot can not .
p4443
aVIt takes a good 4 seconds between shots to process and get ready again .
p4444
aVI know that may sound fast , but it 's not , really .
p4445
aVA lot can happen in 4 seconds , especially with kids !
p4446
aVAnd the last of my complaints -- the camera kept blinking the `` shaky camera '' icon at me , meaning I was n't holding the camera steady .
p4447
aVI 've never had trouble with that before .
p4448
aVMy pictures were never blurry , nor did I shake when using the Kodak .
p4449
aVAll that being said , the camera does take very good pictures when the subject is unmoving and it is easy to use .
p4450
aVIt is very lightweight , but does have a cheap plasticky feel to it .
p4451
aVI am returning the camera and hunting for another Kodak !
p4452
aa(lp4453
VI bought this to take on my honeymoon in Jordan .
p4454
aVIt weighs about the same as a SLR , but you can take single shots as well .
p4455
aVThe night vision feature is great .
p4456
aVBy attaching the camera to my computer via a firewire system , I can also capture still shots from the video mode and print them out .
p4457
aVI love it .
p4458
aVThe TRV20 is small enough to slip in a coat pocket with comfort .
p4459
aVAround the neck or over the shoulder , it does n't cut into you because of the wide strap .
p4460
aVI wish the lens cap had a cord attached to keep up with it .
p4461
aVThe reversable viewing screen is wonderful for showing your movies when a TV hookup is not convenient .
p4462
aVOver all , once you learn all the buttons and features , this is a dandy little unit for amateur or semi-professional alike .
p4463
aa(lp4464
VAfter `` internet research '' I choose the Instax over the Polaroid and I am very glad I did .
p4465
aVIt is very user friendly .
p4466
aVMy guests at the reception were wowed by the size of the camera and film , and it brought back great memories for all of us .
p4467
aa(lp4468
VNow I can sleep peacefully ... This product is excellent , very cheap and easy to be installed .
p4469
aa(lp4470
VI am a DSLR owner that does n't always want to lug around all the equipment and this compact does all the tricks I want it to .
p4471
aVIts very impressive for it 's size and price .
p4472
aVRecently , I had purchased the s95 and returned it when I found out this was being released .
p4473
aVThe s95 is a great camera however , I feel the s100 trumps it .
p4474
aVThe noise is greatly reduced in the s100 .
p4475
aVThe built in ND filter is an amazing addition , and the extra zoom and wide angle while it does n't seem like much , but is .
p4476
aVI could care less about GPS but it might come in handy when I travel .
p4477
aVAll the complaints I am reading about AWB and tints seem either like a defective unit or user error .
p4478
aVThe AWB seems fine to me , and the screen is ultra crisp .
p4479
aVIf you are a quality control freak this is a great addition to your camera bag .
p4480
aVI added two photos that show just how fantastic this little camera can be .
p4481
aVI can not stress enough that DSLR owners will be impressed .
p4482
aa(lp4483
VThere are so many excellent reviews here that I wo n't rehash why I love my 7d , but I have some advice : If you 've been going back and forth on whether or not to get one for at least a week , just go ahead and get one .
p4484
aVI 'm pretty sure you 'll be happy you did .
p4485
aa(lp4486
VTo start off , I am an amateur in the photography department , but I still know my stuff .
p4487
aVI 'll start with the pros and cons .
p4488
aVPros : 1 .
p4489
aVThe ability to take RAW photos .
p4490
aV2 .
p4491
aVThe weight .
p4492
aV3 .
p4493
aVThe Leica lens .

aVThe microphone .
p4508
aVCons : 1 .
p4509
aVBattery compartment is blocked by tripod .
p4510
aV2 .
p4511
aVThe PHOTOfunSTUDIO 4.0 software is pointless .
p4512
aV3 .
p4513
aVThere could have been a paper manual , but I 'm not complaining !
p4514
aVSo explanation of the pros : I love love love the RAW files !
p4515
aVIf you are unaware of RAW files , they are basically digital negatives .
p4516
aVIf you do n't care about RAW files , then just take the photos on the normal JPEG !
p4517
aVMoving on , the weight of the camera is extremely light !
p4518
aVI can hold it for a long time when recording something handheld !
p4519
aVThe lens is a Leica lens , and is manufactured in Germany .
p4520
aVIt is a fantastic lens !
p4521
aVThe zoom basically sold this camera for me .
p4522
aVI will post some photos of before and after the zoom .
p4523
aVThe IA mode the camera has is outstanding .
p4524
aVHowever , I choose to use my own settings to shoot .
p4525
aVThe IA is made for the beginner !
p4526
aVThe other modes are outstanding .
p4527
aVI love the Scene choices -LRB- beach , sunset , fireworks , candle light , etc -RRB- .
p4528
aVThe night portrait mode is also really cool !
p4529
aVThe accessories are really convenient .
p4530
aVI bought a UV protection filter -LRB- href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004ZCJE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/178-3184064-3602029"> Tiffen 46mm UV Protection Filter  -RRB- , and I 'm glad I did .
p4531
aVI also got a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FGTWOC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/178-3184064-3602029"> Joby GP3 Gorillapod SLR-Zoom Flexible Tripod with BH1 Ball Head with Bubble Level for Digital SLR Cameras  and I love it !
p4532
aVWhat also sold this to me was the price !
p4533
aVAmazon had this camera for almost 1\u005c/2 the retail price .
p4534
aVThe video recording is fantastic !
p4535
aVI make videos on YouTube and this camera is going to support me well !
p4536
aV-LRB- ... -RRB- Lastly , the microphone -LRB- which is located on the flash -RRB- works wonders .
p4537
aVIt records SO WELL !
p4538
aVThe cons are pretty self explanatory .
p4539
aVI hope you purchase this camera .
p4540
aVIt is one of my best purchases !

aVI thought I should update my review because it was posted less than a week after my purchase .
p4584
aVFirst off , if you want to see some photos that were taken with this camera , check out my flickr page : -LRB- ... -RRB- .
p4585
aVWhat I love about this camera : 1 .
p4586
aVThe battery life is SUPER !
p4587
aVI can take probably 500 photos with each charge .
p4588
aVThat 's with flash included !
p4589
aV2 .
p4590
aVThe scene modes are absolutely amazing !
p4591
aVI love the panorama assist mode .
p4592
aVI use photoshop to put the photos together and it works out splendidly !
p4593
aV3 .
p4594
aVThe shutter speed !
p4595
aVI make a lot of `` light painting '' shots !
p4596
aV4 .
p4597
aVThe IA mode is still a winner for quick shots .
p4598
aV5 .
p4599
aVThe fact that I spent less than 250 bucks on it ... .
p4600
aV.
p4601
aV6 .
p4602
aVThe zoom !
p4603
aVI love how it can catch things that are far away , unlike my other point and shoot type cameras .
p4604
aVWhat I do n't enjoy about this camera : 1 .
p4605
aVThe awful pictures in low-light ... .
p4606
aVThey are really grainy , and sometimes the tones are off .
p4607
aV2 .
p4608
aVThe battery compartment pops off when I attach my tripod ... 3 .
p4609
aVThe auto-focus is pretty bad .
p4610
aVWhen I 'm taking nature shots , it focuses on the most random things !
p4611
aVI still hope you buy this camera .
p4612
aVI 'm waiting for the money to buy a DSLR soon .
p4613
aVThis is a good beginner camera .
p4614

VI received the camera and it did n't work .
p4617
aVI need to find out how to rectify
p4618
aa(lp4619
VJVC continues to turn out products that are defective and they do not stand behind them .
p4620
aVI bought my daughter a camcorder for her graduation and she is unable to use it because the camera displays an E03 lockdown mode message which disables the camera .
p4621
aVApparently the only way to fix this problem is to bring it to a dealer and pay for the repair .
p4622
aVI also understand that it can be a reoccuring problem .
p4623
aVThere is a class action suit pending .
p4624
aVSpend your hard earned money on a better product .
p4625
aa(lp4626
VGreat camera !
p4627
aVResurrection of the S-series is a good move by Canon !
p4628
aVMy first digital camera was an S30 , which met all my needs for great digital photography\u005c/videos .
p4629
aVWhen it finally broke after 5 years , I had to replace it with an SD850IS because the S-series was no longer available .
p4630
aVEven though SD850 is a great little camera , it never was able to match my S30 .
p4631
aVAnd finally , I 'm happy to say that S90 met my expectations for a great compact in terms of getting great quality pictures , especially in low light .
p4632
aVThe down side ?
p4633
aVNone other than the price .
p4634
aa(lp4635
VDo not buy !
p4636
aVWe bought this camera to take on our honeymoon to Bermuda .
p4637
aVOur first day there we went to a beach and tried the camera underwater for the first time .
p4638
aVIt stopped working after about five minutes in a foot or two of water .
p4639
aVWe got back to shore and opened the battery compartment and it was full of water .
p4640
aVAfter about a day of drying out it would only turn on if you wedged something between the battery and the door to make the battery make better contact with the terminals , but the screen never came back to life .
p4641
aVIt took pictures but there was no way to change settings or see what you were taking pictures of .
p4642
aVQuality of pictuers left something to be desired also , too bad you ca n't give negative stars .
p4643
aa(lp4644
VThis camcorder is what many have waited for : consumer grade digital video without tape .
p4645
aVThe decision to use mainly DVD-R or DVD-RAM is best made early .
p4646
aVFor me , DVD-R is still too expensive to use .
p4647
aVDVD-RAM allows reuse , as well as in-camera editing .

VThis camera has so many great features going for it , which is hard not to pass up .
p4666
aVForget the tech specs , it takes high resolution pictures -LRB- so you need a good lens -RRB- .
p4667
aVThe most notable features that I find practical are : - wireless commander mode for flash - Customizable menu - Shooting mode dial to select continuous high , low , single , remote , mirror up , etc - The live view on the screen is pretty useful in difficult shooting situations -LRB- surprisingly -RRB- - The horizon level in live view - U1 and U2 shooting modes - Button placement\u005c/navigation through menus - The top LCD screen -LRB- yeah you can find that on other DSLRs too -RRB- - bracketing -LRB- also not exclusive to this camera -RRB- - fast burst shooting - fast autofocus - easily customizable - built solid - long battery life My camera has traveled the world with me .
p4668
aVIt 's been used for nearly everything such as portraits , events , landscape , street photography , etc. .
p4669
aVAfter shooting with this camera for a year , I have a couple of knit-picks too : - The menu for live view is not that great .
p4670
aVIt 's easy to use because it 's a little too simplified .
p4671
aV- High resolution is great but it picks up too many details for certain types of shots -LRB- especially portraits -RRB- .
p4672
aVThis is bad with some lenses .
p4673
aVIn some ways I prefer the D80 because it 's not as high res , so it looks smoother .
p4674
aVHowever , this can be fixed by lowering the resolution for the pictures when it 's necessary .
p4675
aV- Since it 's still new , accessories are expensive for it .
p4676
aVThe battery grip or an extra battery is not cheap .
p4677
aVOverall , I love this camera .
p4678
aVI 've customized the menu for my needs and become quite familiar with it for a quick snap .
p4679
aVI honestly believe it to be one of the best DSLRs available right now .
p4680
aV\u005c* side note - because this camera has so many options\u005c/features , it may be a little too advanced for some folks .
p4681
aVI have a friend who is constantly frustrated and confused with what buttons to push in what situation .
p4682
aVIt 's kind of funny to watch , but may have become a costly mistake .
p4683
aVGet your hands on the camera to try it out , or any other model for that matter .
p4684
aVTake photography classes if you have to !
p4685
aVIf it 's not in your comfort level , you 'll have blown your money on an expensive product for no reason .
p4686
aa(lp4687
VAll the acsessories in this package are poor quality .
p4688
aVI complained to the seller and they did send me a bigger tripod and bag .
p4689
aVThe bag was great , the tripod was just a bigger version of total crap .
p4690
aVYou would never trust this tripod to hold your HEAVY two thousand dollar camera , That 's if you could actually get it to attach .
p4691
aVThe generic battery has half the life of the canon battery .
p4692
aVThe card reader prongs bent the first I used it .
p4693
aVI use nothing but the charger from this kit , Oh the lens cleaning tissue works well .
p4694
aa(lp4695
VI love this camera .
p4696
aVIt 's the best Point and Shoot camera I 've used .
p4697
aVLots of great accessories and the photos it takes are amazing .
p4698
aVLots of great options on par with a higher end dSLR camera .
p4699
aVCompact enough to fit in a jacket pocket .
p4700
aVI ca n't say enough good things about this camera .
p4701
aVThe `` retro '' body style is also quite nice .
p4702
aVI also recommend getting the auto lens cap accessory sold by various 3rd party suppliers as well .
p4703
aa(lp4704
VI totally fell in love with it the moment I got it .
p4705
aVIt 's a great product , takes amazing picture , and is worth the money .
p4706
aVI got a super deal here too , with the 18-200mm lens .
p4707
aVI had a friend how had it for a greater price than I did .
p4708
aVLike all DSLR cameras , you need to learn how to use it if you have not used one before .
p4709
aVBut it is really worth it .
p4710
aVAllows me to take pictures I was not able to before .
p4711
aVYou can see the difference .
p4712
aa(lp4713
VI agree with what others here are saying , but feel as if I may have to return my camera because the hotspot caused by a flash that can not `` throttle '' down on its own , is bothersome .
p4714
aVVery bothersome .
p4715
aVI may put a piece of frosted tape or plastic in front of the lens to help , but I certainly should not have to do this .
p4716
aa(lp4717
Vthis camera is awesome .
p4718
aV.
p4719
aVit takes beautiful pictures and is easy to use .
p4720
aVThe only thing I can think of - in a negative respect - is it does n't take pics of moving objects very well , but I guess it would if they were taken as a video , which I have yet to try .
p4721
aVFor the money , you ca n't go wrong with this camera .
p4722
aVI 'd highly recommend it to anyone !!!
p4723
aa(lp4724
VI purchased this particular ELM327 interface which arrived quickly and the packaging was fine .
p4725
aVI plugged it into the car and noticed the diagnostic lights were positioned against the underside of the dash .
p4726
aVThe device slowly linked up to Torque -LRB- Android phone app -RRB- , and would update very slowly , or freeze up intermittently .
p4727
aVI bought another scanner , only this time it was labeled Soliport ELM 327 , and it works flawless .
p4728
aVA few differences I should point out between the two units .
p4729
aVI will refer to the problematic scanner as A and the good , working one as B. - -LRB- A -RRB- has a nub on the back end of the case , where -LRB- B -RRB- is flat - The cut-out notch\u005c/tab for the ODBII interface on -LRB- B -RRB- is on the same side as the label and diagnostic lights - The product image for -LRB- B -RRB- showed the cut-out notch\u005c/tab being on the same side as the label and diagnostic lights - -LRB- B -RRB- syncs up quickly and provides almost instant stats -LRB- there is about a fraction of a second delay which was to be expected -RRB- - The mini-CD that comes with -LRB- B -RRB- , arrived in a mini jewel case , while the mini-CD that came with -LRB- A -RRB- was in a paper sleeve - When linked via Bluetooth , -LRB- A -RRB- displayed as CBT , while -LRB- B -RRB- displayed as OBDII In conclusion , I am not sure if the first model I purchased was a knockoff or just a different version .
p4730
aVYour best bet I think is to search for the `` Soliport '' version of this device .
p4731
aVAlso , ensure that your purchase is fully covered under Amazon 's return policy , as you stand a chance of receiving the faulty version .
p4732
aa(lp4733
VI bought this camera 6 months ago .
p4734
aVwithin that time i have had to get a replacement 3 times .
p4735
aVAnd as of today -LRB- 6 months after buying it -RRB- I have to return it again .
p4736
aVIt keeps getting an odd black dot in all the pictures .
p4737
aVThere is nothing on the lens or inside .
p4738
aVIt just continually has this weird black dot show up .
p4739
aVI will never buy this camera again .
p4740
aVIf you want a great camera dont buy this one .

VI ordered this camera the night before my wedding and had it in my hands at 9AM the next morning , but that 's not what 's important .
p4744
aVI was using this thing for the first time during my honeymoon and it was crazy awesome .
p4745
aVMy full setup was href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZS2EU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-6594984-0414305"> Dolica WT-1003 67-Inch Lightweight Monopod  , href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V7AF8E/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-6594984-0414305"> Vista Explorer 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Tripod Bag  , href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000L47AHG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-6594984-0414305"> Professional Mini Ball Head Camera Mount  , and href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PO3EM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-6594984-0414305"> Lowepro Edit 100 Camcorder Bag -LRB- Black -RRB-  .
p4746
aVIt takes a little learning to find where all the settings are -LRB- very little is done via physical controls -RRB- but the camera is very helpful .
p4747
aVIt actually has documentation in the camera - a help button you can select and popups that explain every setting you select .
p4748
aVYou can use the touchscreen or the physical dial\u005c/buttons for just about anything , your choice .
p4749
aVI find I generally prefer the physical controls which let me use the thumb of my right hand as I am gripping the camera , but the touch screen option comes in handy more often than I thought it would .
p4750
aVAlso the ability to touch a spot on the screen and have it focus on that is very nice .
p4751
aVI had a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041RSPRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-6594984-0414305"> Canon G12 10 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.8 Inch Vari-Angle LCD  for a month before this one and I do not miss it -LRB- Canon 's G series has tons of dedicated physical controls which are handy for learning photography via experimentation -RRB- .
p4752
aVComparison to href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041RSPRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-6594984-0414305"> Canon G12  : I was unsure of this purchase at first because comparison images from this camera and the href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041RSPRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-6594984-0414305"> Canon G12  on sites like dpreview.com did n't indicate a clear winner , despite the Sony 's 8.5 x larger sensor and bigger lens .
p4753
aVHowever , within 5 minutes of turning on the Sony I was pretty well convinced .
p4754
aVHaving taken this thing to Bora Bora for a week I am absolutely certain it was the right choice , even in spite of the price difference .
p4755
aVThis camera is fast , it does n't take much work to get great images out of it , and if you want to take control it has all the settings you 'd expect and lots of impressive features to use .
p4756
aVThe HDR and panorama modes are insane , as are its video capabilities .
p4757
aVVideo recording has its own physical button , so you can start recording video instantly without changing modes\u005c/settings or even looking at the screen first .
p4758
aVOne potential negative to note is that Sony has gone the Sony way with this camera - proprietary and\u005c/or esoteric accessories .
p4759
aVThe attachment port for the flash is not a standard hot shoe .
p4760
aVThey call it `` Smart Accessory Terminal 2 '' .
p4761
aVThey 'd have to change the shape of the camera to fit a standard one on here .
p4762
aVAlso the lenses are E-mount type .
p4763
aVAgain , I think this is b\u005c/c they are smaller than standard lenses , but it does limit selection .
p4764
aVThere 's some sort of adapter for regular lenses , but it has limitations -LRB- and cost -RRB- of it 's own .
p4765
aVI do n't know much about all that since this is my first camera with interchangeable anything on it , which is another thing to note about my review of this product .
p4766
aa(lp4767
VI purchased this camcorder about 3 weeks ago .
p4768
aVIts working fine and I 'm still learning its full details .
p4769
aVSo , far I have not had any major troubles .
p4770
aa(lp4771
VThis camera is probably more than I needed , but I love it .
p4772
aVThe zoom is awesome .
p4773
aVIt takes great pictures and will probably do much better once I learn all the features .
p4774
aa(lp4775
VReceived as a gift .
p4776
aVCharged it up as instructed .
p4777
aVWo n't stay running for more than 5 minutes , self-shutting down saying its too hot .
p4778
aVIt is 68 degrees in the house and the device has n't been near anything hot .
p4779
aVAlso , after a couple minutes it would freeze up - the image and the buttons .
p4780
aVThis happened multiple times .
p4781
aVThe only remedy is to remove the battery .
p4782
aVOnline support had me reset it with 10 seconds of power button press .
p4783
aVDid n't solve the freeze problem .
p4784
aVThey wanted me to use `` another new set '' of AAA or AA disposables , even after I told them multiple times I was operating on the chargeable battery it came with .
p4785
aV-LRB- tech was either unattentive , juggling many of us at at time , or is english language challenged I suspect -RRB- That aside , the next test they wanted was for me to leave the battery out for 2 DAYS for it to fully `` refresh '' .
p4786
aVNo thanks , this gift is going back .
p4787
aVWe WILL try a replacement - if its even in stock now , which the gifter says is doubtful .
p4788
aVI am worried after Googling this model for these woes .
p4789
aVBut if it works reliably , I 'll report that here too .
p4790
aVAt any rate , Christmas day videos are a no-go for us now , thanks to Cisco .
p4791
aVThe gifter wife is NOT happy either !
p4792
aVUPDATE 12\u005c/26\u005c/10 : Exchanged at store where bought today .
p4793
aVThis one charged fine  took video for an hour and a half without freezing or overheating .
p4794
aVMore testing by me is warranted .
p4795
aVI hate testing such a brand new device being uncertain whether I 've been taken .
p4796
aVConcerns still remain : 1 -RRB- 32 % of reviews here at Amazon on this device are 1 or 2 as of 12\u005c/26\u005c/10 - that 's pretty bad .
p4797
aV2 -RRB- some reviews testify troubles over time , making me concerned we 've wasted a lot of money .
p4798
aV3 -RRB- to register the device with Cisco , one must create a Cisco account - the site never responded to my completed registration SUBMIT and went to a Cisco session time-out page .
p4799
aV4 -RRB- and last but not least , I am very concerned with the bad testimony here about , and my own weak experience with , Cisco customer support , leaving me very unimpressed with my first Cisco purchase .
p4800
aVI leave my assessment at 1 star ... for now .
p4801
aa(lp4802
VExcellent camera !
p4803
aVVery nice red glossy finish , superb picture quality , Smartphoto technology : features that finds your face and adapts to the lighting of the scenery and much more !
p4804
aVVery easy to use , very portable -LRB- smaller than a large hand -RRB- and what else must I say ?
p4805
aVOh yeah !
p4806
aVThe price is a must buy !
p4807
aVBest camera I have had and I HIGHLY recommend it
p4808
aa(lp4809
VI 've had this item for three months now and still have n't been able to get it to stop taking images of nothing .
p4810
aVThe camera itself works great night and day , but the alarm system will trigger with no changes in the room and floods my e-mail every day at random intervals throughout the day sometimes for hours at a time .
p4811
aVSorting through hundreds of empty , causeless alerts really brings down the value .
p4812
aVThat aside , it ALSO does detect when there is motion and works perfectly for that .
p4813
aVHowever , it 's a severe limitation that you have to be logged in through the browser viewing the application .
p4814
aVOccasionally internet explorer will crash and I wo n't have video logs for the day and will be unaware that it 's happened .
p4815
aVI want to like this camera , it arrived quickly and on time but definitely is n't working right for me .
p4816
aa(lp4817
VThis camera is the best camera for the price !
p4818
aVIt is the best camera I have ever owned !
p4819
aVPicture quality is outstanding and for a novice photographer like myself it is very user friendly .
p4820
aVIt is easy to hold and well balanced .
p4821
aVOnly down side is wish the flash was automatic , other than that it is a great camera !
p4822
aVHighly recommend it for the novice and experienced photographer !!!
p4823
aVEasy , fun , great photo 's ; great manufacturer .
p4824
aVThank you .

aa(lp4826
VWas not expacting a whole lot given the price of the camera .
p4827
aVI watched some youtube videos to compare the quality of the smaller camers which helped .
p4828
aVThis camers works well in natural light .
p4829
aVI tried using it at night with just incandescant lights around and the picture was slightly dark and grainy even on the high def settings .
p4830
aVIn natural light the picture is much clearer and nice looking .
p4831
aVHave not used the camera under water yet so I ca n't comment there .
p4832
aVOverall it is a decent buy for the price .
p4833
aa(lp4834
VI usually have never had a bad experience with Sony camera 's .
p4835
aVI love the pixels on this camera , I love that my pictures are never washed out , I love the macro setting .
p4836
aVBut ... after 8 months , my flash stopped working .
p4837
aVIt does n't matter what setting I 'm on , even with the flash set on permanently , nothing .
p4838
aVEven restoring the camera to the default factory settings did n't make my flash work again .
p4839
aVI had to contact Sony and luckily it 's still under warranty .
p4840
aVThey are going to repair it for free .
p4841
aVJust beware though - it seems from searching online , this model does have problems with the built in flash dying .
p4842
aa(lp4843
VRecently purchased this camera for a trip to Hawaii .
p4844
aVI was comparing it to the Canon G12 and Nikon P7000 .
p4845
aVI did n't really want the bulk of a dSLR but wanted some manual control of my pictures .
p4846
aVIn addition speed was important to me after experiencing an Olympus Stylus Tough .
p4847
aVThat camera had about a 5 second shot to shot time .
p4848
aVThat is not acceptable in a place where you could miss whales and dolphins waiting on your camera .
p4849
aVThis camera was very fast for a point and shoot .
p4850
aVIn addition it gave me shots that looked like that had been digitally touched up before I even got them off the camera .
p4851
aVI was very impressed with the quality and speed of the pictures .
p4852
aa(lp4853
VFrom the packaging it looks very nice .

VI would not like to repeat the accolades posted here by others , many of which I share .
p4932
aVLet me focus on some aspects not mentioned otherwise .
p4933
aVThis is Canon 's 12th generation of their G-series , refined and tuned in small steps .
p4934
aVAfter the G10 disaster they came to senses and lowered the amount of megapixels in favor of a better image quality and low light performance .
p4935
aVGood call , excellent !
p4936
aVWe also like the front modal wheel added , however in many cases its operation is limited , as if added in the last moment and and not really incorporated into the generic function of the camera .
p4937
aVAnd , at the time of their release -LRB- 2nd half 2010 -RRB- only this camera and the Nikon P7000 -LRB- which we also have -RRB- provide both : a -RRB- an optical viewfinder , b -RRB- RAW format .
p4938
aVDo not listen to people calling the viewfinder `` pathetic '' or using any other such strong negative denotation .
p4939
aVThis is a bare nonsense .
p4940
aVDo not compare the G12 viewfinder to the large and heavy viewfinders in cameras like the 7D or D300 .
p4941
aVCompare the viewfinder rather to any even most modern end-of-2010 EVF -LRB- Electronic Viewfinder -RRB- .
p4942
aVI am an ardent SLR -LRB- now DSLR -RRB- user , and I find the Optical Viewfinder in both G12 and P7000 adequate and a blessing .
p4943
aVConsidering the weight , size and price , both are somewhat limited , sure .
p4944
aVBut they zoom with the lens , and they allow me and my wife to photograph in full sun light .
p4945
aVNo current LCD display or an EVF comes even close to the image showed by this viewfinder .
p4946
aVThe time , or even an ` Era of EVF ' might be to come , but it is not there yet .
p4947
aVPeople who use darkening glasses , or any sort of glasses which might polarize light , find vast majority of modern cameras unusable in sun light .
p4948
aVWe tried the expensive Lumix\u005c/Leica with their viewfinder .
p4949
aVIt is dark like looking through a dirty glass or a curtain .
p4950
aVCompared to such EVF 's the optical viewfinders in G12 or P7000 are superior .
p4951
aVWhy ?
p4952
aVBecause only an optical viewfinder passes light energy proportional to the ambient light , thus to the light to which our eyes are attuned to .
p4953
aVYoung people who never used film cameras got accustom to the photography on arms length .
p4954
aVNot so people who used film cameras all life long !
p4955
aVI virtually always prefer the optical viewfinder , and I place my camera close to my eye for better stability .
p4956
aVIf you do not want the viewfinder , of course the Canon S95 is a better choice .
p4957
aVSame sensor , same RAW format , tiny size , less money .
p4958
aVCompared to P7000 : shorter lens , but boy , the Nikon is dramatically slow when used in RAW mode .
p4959
aVTheir new firmware improved this by good 40 % , what shows the extend of the blunder which they have committed .
p4960
aVEven with this improved speed the G12 outguns the P7000 by almost 3:1 in speed of raw image storage .
p4961
aVIf you do action , forget the P7000 and take the Canon !
p4962
aVImage quality seem comparable in both cameras .
p4963
aVWhen you stay with no more than ISO 800 , the G12 produces very nice results , in many cases completely competitive with any older DSLR of 10Mpix resolution .
p4964
aVGood news is that even the ISO 1600 noise can be processed to a small size image for web or printing -LRB- say 2-3Mbytes effective , -RRB- which looks great and serves its purpose .
p4965
aVThis gives a city or event photographer a greater mobility and allows to operate more inconspicuous .
p4966
aVShould you need the larger resolution , neither the G12 nor the P7000 will win any `` low light awards . ''
p4967
aVEven the bottom level DSLR 's will beat them to a pulp .
p4968
aVKnow your limitation !

VI was looking for a great point  shoot camera to replace my old Canon SD750 .
p4983
aVI have a kid on the way , and so I really wanted a camera that can take incredible baby pictures and then , later on , capture a moving toddler .
p4984
aVAfter thorough research , my sights were set on the Sony Cybershot DSC HX9V , which had garnered impressive reviews from several leading websites and many positive customers reviews .
p4985
aVI went to Best Buy to feel it out , and did n't really expect it to be there since it had practically sold out everywhere online during the Christmas season and I was planning to backorder it anyway .
p4986
aVWell , lo and behold , there was a returned camera waiting at the store .
p4987
aVTurns out somebody had bought the camera , stolen the cord and AC adaptor , and returned it saying that Sony had `` forgotten to include it in the box . ''
p4988
aVHaha , what a laugh !
p4989
aVThe Best Buy associate was totally pissed , because here was a perfect camera missing the proprietary accessories , returned practically untouched .
p4990
aVSo anyway , I picked it up and immediately I knew that this device was something entirely different than what I was accustomed to , and simultaneously thrilling to hold and snap photos with .
p4991
aVThe zoom lens promptly caught my interest .
p4992
aVI was able to zoom in on a boxed stereo about 200m across the store , take a picture , and then when I zoomed into the photo I could clearly read the font that was no more than 1 inch in height .
p4993
aVTalk about an eagle-eyed zoom lens !
p4994
aVEach photo I snapped in that lifeless box store was amazing and vibrant .
p4995
aVI took pictures of employees , zooming into their zitty pores , rows of overpriced Chinese electrionic bric-a-brac , a pigeon who had somehow flown into the store and patiently waited in the rafters for someone to drop some crumbs from their granola bar .
p4996
aVEventually , I said thanks and departed the store , and immediately ordered this camera from Crutchfield .
p4997
aVEven though it was on backorder , it came in less than a week .
p4998
aVEver since , I have taken the most incredibly awesome photos of everything - my glowing , pregnant wife -LRB- she loves the `` soft skin '' setting -RRB- , my cats , my neighborhood , the zoo , etc. .
p4999
aVAlmost every picture I have taken is magazine-quality in my opinion .
p5000
aVLow light shots are ridiculously good compared with my old Canon P .
p5001
aVMovement shots , such as my cats jumping off the kitchen counter with their feet coated in bernaise sauce , are incredible , as well .
p5002
aVThe panoramic function is spellbinding .
p5003
aVI have n't used the 3D mode yet because I do n't know anyone with a 3D television , but I 'm curious as to what the future might hold in that regard .
p5004
aVVideo is so clear , I think I could literally film an HD reality television show .
p5005
aVSteadycam technology has come a long way .
p5006
aVEven bounding around the house was smooth , like the opening credits of HBO 's `` Tales From the Crypt '' -LRB- I just needed a good Danny Elfman score -RRB- .
p5007
aVThis camera is packed with features and I could spend about an hour discussing all the ones I 've tried , but I 've only tried about half of the settings available on this divine contraption .
p5008
aVCa n't wait to take it on vacations .
p5009
aVIn conclusion , this is the best camera I have ever used in my life , better quality than many affordable DLSRs you will find on the market , and capable of taking the sharpest pictures imaginable with 16.2 mexapixels .
p5010
aVThe menus and functions are easy to navigate , it 's reactivity is exquisite , it 's functionality is unmatched by other point and shoots , and it takes triumphant pictures of felines , rambunctious five year-olds , and active preggo wives .
p5011
aVThumbs up !

VI purchased 2 DSC P100 's recently , both of which exhibited a clicking noise in all `` shoot '' modes -LRB- camera  video -RRB- , but not in review or set up modes .

p5015

aVWell worth the money

p5040
aVThe only real limitation is your imagination .

aVWant to take an outdoor picture ?
p5042
aVGo outdoors and hit the button .
p5043
aVSimilar procedures for indoor pictures .
p5044
aVCan also take videos which means potentially you can use this to make money or gain fame .
p5045
aVOnce videos are made you can easily send these off to America 's Funniest Home Videos or Tosh .0 .
p5046
aVI guess you could go on youtube as well or other internets .
p5047
aVThe pictures can also be uploaded to facebook and then people can comment on them .
p5048
aVAll from one camera .
p5049
aVIf you were to travel back in time with this camera people would be amazed , however you would n't be able to do anything with the pictures but look at them on your camera as computers may not have yet been invented .
p5050
aa(lp5051
VSummary : A pocket sized camcorder which ca n't decide between being a `` point and shoot '' and a more fully featured model - some very nice features but overall too many functions and features make it harder and less enjoyable to use .
p5052
aVDefinitely not for everybody .
p5053
aVI 'm a certifiable gadget geek and several years ago bought a first generation Flip Video camera to supplement our regular MiniDV and 3CCD MiniDV camcorders .
p5054
aVI also have a mini `` spy '' cam for rockets and such so this is actually our FIFTH camcorder I was intrigued by the swiveling lens .
p5055
aVThis is by far the best feature .
p5056
aVIt protects the lens and also acts as an on-off switch -LRB- there is another on off switch in case you want to view images with the lens closed -RRB- or turn it off with the lens open .
p5057
aVIt 's also a nice piece of design , although I would have preferred black .
p5058
aVWhite looks kind of funky on the back since the bezel , etc is black .
p5059
aVNOTE : There is a thin piece of protective plastic covering the screen .
p5060
aVI almost did n't realize .
p5061
aVYou can leave it on as a screen protector but with it off , the contrast , etc is noticibly better .
p5062
aVThere are other features which are nice -LRB- still images , etc -RRB- but by loading this camcorder up with functions it actually becomes more confusing and harder to use .
p5063
aVI wo n't list them all as an example , you can select between five resolutions -LRB- 1080@30FPS,720@60FPS,720@30FPS,640x460 -RRB- This camcorder is pocketable but the size is nothing to write home about - it 's as big as a typical smart phone but definitely bigger than today 's cell phones .
p5064
aV-LRB- nearly identical to my HTC touch pro , same size as the first generation flip without the bulge , noticibly larger than a Motorola RAZR or Samsung A900 -RRB- .
p5065
aVThen there is the record button location .
p5066
aVIt 's thin , narrow , and on one side .
p5067
aVMore than once I 've found myself having to hit the button again because it did n't register .
p5068
aVErgonomically this sucks , plus you get an extra shake at the start and finish of each video you shoot unless you 're really careful .
p5069
aVIn addition , I was appalled by the low light performance for 720P @ 60 FPS .
p5070
aVEven at 30 FPS 1080 or 720 , the low light performance was not as good as our first gen Flip Video .
p5071
aVThis was in a relatively dim restaurant at night , but not an unusual situation to be in .
p5072
aVThe Flip gave acceptable video - this did not .
p5073
aVLikes - Swivel lens - Charge via USB cable - Removable battery -LRB- allows spare battery capability -RRB- - Standard tripod socket on bottom - Large playback screen - Takes SD Cards -LRB- I did n't realize it when I first bought it , but I just confirmed that it will -RRB- Dislikes - MP4 recording format required additional software to be loaded to computer .
p5074
aV- Low light performance for video - Off axis on\u005c/off button not ergonomic - No flash for stills - Larger than you would expect p.s. .
p5075
aVThe comment from Ahmed Bader was ironically a cut and paste of my comment on HIS review which is clearly lifted from the Sony press release .
p5076
aVIf you 've found this review helpful , or have questions \u005c/ comments , please let me know !
p5077
aa(lp5078
VThis camera is just what I was looking for , and was priced where I could afford it .
p5079
aVI have taken several hundred pictures with it in the short time I 've had it , and am extremely happy .
p5080
aa(lp5081
VI know this one is $ 3.00 less than the flash version , but I think you 'll like the quality of the pictures with the flash disposable better .
p5082
aVYou can use the flash for outdoor pictures as well as for indoor ones , and they tend to come out better .
p5083
aVPlus you have the option of using it indoors at the end of the day .
p5084
aVReasonable picture quality \u005c* for the price \u005c* - if you wanna take photos for National Geographic , you 'll need to pay a bit more than $ 6.00 for your camera !
p5085
aV: -RRB-
p5086
aa(lp5087
VI love this camera .
p5088
aVI have been using it since last summer and its performance is great so far .
p5089
aVI took thousands of pictures in New York and all Europe and I am really happy about my pictures .
p5090
aVI strongly recommend this camera .
p5091
aVBut , low light performance can be a problem if you do n't have tripod .
p5092
aa(lp5093
VI had read in some reviews that the Zx3 has a larger sensor so I ended up ordering that one .
p5094
aVThe low light performance was a disaster .
p5095
aVSo I ordered the Zx5 .
p5096
aVThis has much better performance -LRB- comparatively -RRB- .
p5097
aVAlso the -LRB- internal -RRB- battery on the Zx5 seems to last much longer .
p5098
aVThe shockproof feature is great as I can hand it off to my toddler without worrying too much .
p5099
aVHave n't exercised the waterproof feature yet .
p5100
aVMy first experience returning stuff -LRB- Zx3 -RRB- bought at Amazon and I was pleased to see how smooth the return and refund was .
p5101
aa(lp5102
VCamera takes very good pics .
p5103
aVSome focusing problems `` locking on '' -LRB- in the auto mode -RRB- occassionaly .
p5104
aVSeems the close photos are when it has most focusing issues for me .
p5105
aVI mean 12 '' -16 '' close or so .
p5106
aVOtherwise the camera is great .
p5107
aVThe pop up flash is tricky but once you know where it pops up , you should not have a problem .
p5108
aa(lp5109
VIt is easy to set up .
p5110
aVImage quality is average and construction is cheap , but hey , you get what you pay for .
p5111
aVI would have given it a higher rating except for these caveats : 1 -RRB- Although Mac OS X is supported , you do n't get full functionality -LRB- e.g you do n't get zoom and preset views -RRB- unless you use Internet Explorer -LRB- that leaves Mac and Linux users out -RRB- ; 2 -RRB- its response to the web controls is inconsistent and slow ; 2 -RRB- it 's not really providing streaming video , it 's actually rapidly refreshing jpeg images ; and 3 -RRB- good documentation is hard to find .
p5112
aVFor expert documentation , see -LRB- ... -RRB- All in all , this camera is a good deal for the price and if you use Internet Explorer .
p5113
aa(lp5114
VBought this camera for Christmas .
p5115
aVHad her open it first so she could film the nights party  NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED !
p5116
aVOf course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after .
p5117
aVShame on Sony .
p5118
aVHow much would a tape included in the packace cost them ?
p5119
aVNot included Battery chargers are ...
p5120
aa(lp5121
VI am very disappointed in the performance of this camera .
p5122
aVBuyers BEWARE !!
p5123
aVAfter recording only two dv tapes in six months documenting my newborn son 's first months at home , I decided to transfer the footage to VHS .
p5124
aVUpon rewinding the tapes , an error message of Eject the tape flashed upon the screen .
p5125
aVI ejected this tape and tried the other one .
p5126
aVAgain this message flashed across the screen .
p5127
aVUpon further inspection , I found that the camcorder had mangled both of these tapes -- mind you Panasonic tapes -- .
p5128
aVNow , I am stuck with a piece of junk and ruined tapes of my child 's first months of life .
p5129
aVI can honestly say that I will not be buying any other Sharp products ...
p5130
aa(lp5131
VThe short review : I 've owned this camera for a week and tested it out thoroughly .
p5132
aVIf you want the smallest , most convenient camera possible , this is the one for you .
p5133
aVIf you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality , this is the one for you .
p5134
aVIf you want ultimate still-picture quality , this is not the one for you .
p5135
aVThe long review : I bought this camera to replace my aging Sony DSC-T7 .
p5136
aVI loved the thinness and convenience of the T7 , but after four years it was getting long in the tooth -- at only 5.1 megapixels , 3x zoom , and 640x480 video , it 's almost prehistoric by today 's standards .
p5137
aVI watched the evolution of Sony 's thin cameras after the T7 and T9 , but was distressed to see that after they added the touch screens , the cameras bulged out to more than twice as thick as the T7 .
p5138
aVThe whole point of a thin camera is that you can slip it into your pocket and forget it 's there .
p5139
aVThe T900 was almost twice as thick as the thinnest part of the T7 , which was a deal-breaker for me .
p5140
aVSo I was happy to see the TX1 appear earlier this year .
p5141
aVIt 's still thicker than the T7 , but when you put them side by side it 's a pretty close call , and the TX1 's curvaceous body makes it feel a bit thinner than it is .
p5142
aVAt 10.2 megapixels , 4x zoom , and 1280x720 video , the specs are about twice as good as the T7 .
p5143
aVBut looking at the reviews was a bit discouraging .
p5144
aVThe highly technical reviewers generally praised it , but many everyday users reported problems .
p5145
aVI decided to buy a TX1 anyway , and I 'm glad I did .
p5146
aVFirst the cons .
p5147
aVLike any camera this size , they had to make sacrifices to get the smallness .
p5148
aVThe image quality is not going to be as good as a larger camera with a non-folded lens system and a bigger sensor .
p5149
aVIf you do very careful shots of standard test patterns , you can see that there 's a tiny bit of fuzziness near the edges of the picture when you zoom in , and the image has more grain at a given light level than a large camera would have .
p5150
aVYou can check Imaging Resource 's review of the TX1 for details .
p5151
aVMy main problem with it -LRB- as with the T7 -RRB- is that when you take pictures in very low light with the flash on , your subjects can look white and washed out if you 're not careful .
p5152
aVYou can fix this by using the slow-synchro flash setting and by standing back further from your subject , but it takes some experimentation to learn to use it well .
p5153
aVAs others have commented , you really do need to read the manual , experiment with the settings , and learn how to get the best results with it .
p5154
aVBut no one should be buying this camera because they want the best possible picture quality .
p5155
aVIf that 's what you 're after , you really should buy a DSLR .
p5156
aVThey 're much bigger , but the image quality is unmatched .
p5157
aVThe real reason to buy this camera is to take pictures that you would n't take otherwise .
p5158
aVWhen I 'm going to a friend 's house for a party , or going out on the town , I do n't want to drag along a DSLR , or even a `` normal '' 2-inch-thick camera .
p5159
aVI want a camera that I do n't know is there , that I can whip out in 2 seconds to snap off a shot .
p5160
aVWhen I 'm on vacation on the beach , I do n't want to hang a camera case around my neck , I want something that fits in my pocket with room to spare .
p5161
aVWith that in mind , this camera has tons of great features .
p5162
aVFirst , the low-light performance is outstanding .
p5163
aVSony touts their new `` Exmor R '' sensor chips highly , but I 'm the skeptical type , so I did a head-to-head comparison with my old T7 .
p5164
aVThe result : you can really see the difference .
p5165
aVIn a room illuminated by only a thin string of Christmas lights , with the flash turned off , the TX1 could produce a good picture in its `` Hand-held Twilight '' mode .
p5166
aVThe T7 produced a full frame of black in the same situation .
p5167
aVThe same goes for video : the TX1 can take a usable video in a candlelit room , where the T7 just shows black noise .
p5168
aVThis low-light ability is great for taking pictures and video in museums , restaurants , concerts , bars , and other dark places where a flash is either not allowed , or does n't help .
p5169
aVThe TX1 automatically switches between different modes depending on the lighting and distance to the subject .
p5170
aVIf you hold it close to a flower , it switches into Macro mode .
p5171
aVIf you hold it even closer , it switches to Close Focus mode , which is almost like a microscope !
p5172
aVIn the dark , it switches to Twilight mode .
p5173
aVIt 's like the automatic transmission in a car , where it finds the best gear on its own .
p5174
aVMy favorite hidden feature is the `` Dual Shot '' option .
p5175
aVIn difficult lighting conditions , it 'll take two pictures in quick succession , but with different exposure settings , so you can choose which one you like best .
p5176
aVI 've found that it 's best to make those decisions looking at the pictures at full size on a computer screen , rather than on the camera screen -- a shot that looks washed out or too bright on the camera screen is often perfect when seen on a larger monitor .
p5177
aVI 'd guess they 're cranking up the brightness of the camera screen a bit to make it more visible in sunlight .
p5178
aVThe `` Anti Motion Blur '' and `` Hand-held Twilight '' modes each take six pictures in quick succession , then combine them to reduce noise and blurriness .
p5179
aVThey both work well , though the results are even better if you brace the camera somehow instead of shooting totally freehand .
p5180
aVStill , it beats the pants off the T7 , where I 'd have to make several attempts to shoot a freehand picture in low light before I got one where my hand did n't shake .
p5181
aVThere 's also an option to set a two-second timer , so you can push the shutter button , then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo .
p5182
aVThe video quality is great for a camera this small .
p5183
aVI used running dogs as a test , and the results were impressive -- there was no digital blockiness near their fast-moving legs , and the image quality was good even when panning the camera around .
p5184
aVYou can zoom in and out while filming , and I could n't hear the zoom motor in the video clips .
p5185
aVThe microphone is mono , not stereo , but it 's sensitive and the sound quality is good .
p5186
aVThe touch screen is very responsive , well-organized , and easy to use .
p5187
aVIt controls everything but the zoom , shutter , and on\u005c/off switch , but it 's quick enough where I never found myself wishing for more physical buttons .
p5188
aVLike other LCD screens , it can be hard to see in bright sunlight , but it 's still usable .
p5189
aVAll in all , I 'm very happy with the TX1 .
p5190
aVIt 's perfect for what I bought it for , and if you read the manual and learn how to use it , you 'll get great results .
p5191
aa(lp5192
VOver the past year I have done a lot of work with network IP cameras including high-end commercial models from Axis Communications ; mid-range units from Panasonic and budget cameras from Foscam .
p5193
aVI have worked extensively with three Foscam camera models - FI8918W Pan\u005c/Tilt , FI8909W-NA fixed camera and the FI8904W fixed outdoor model .
p5194
aVAll of these cameras were purchased directly from China rather than from Amazon , because Amazon did not offer them when I made my purchases , however , Amazon 's price is very good and I would purchase any future units from them .
p5195
aVThe Foscam cameras are made by Foscam Intelligent Technologies Co. , Ltd. in Shenzhen , China .
p5196
aVTheir website is often down , apparently due to China 's pervasive interference with its Internet service .
p5197
aVDespite this , Foscam 's support via email is quite responsive considering the time difference .
p5198
aVThese cameras have proven reliable after months of service both indoors and outdoors .
p5199
aVAll of the camera models have been installed outdoors in semi-protected locations , such as under a building eve and the model FI8904W has weathered a less protected location where only the rear of the camera was shielded from rain .
p5200
aVNote : only the front of the FI8904W is water resistant , despite what the brochure says .
p5201
aVThese cameras are consumer grade with a small sensor and a plastic lens .
p5202
aVDisplay resolution is modest at 640 x 480 Pixels -LRB- 300k Pixels -RRB- .
p5203
aVThey are adequate for general observation and surveillance and are especially good for monitoring a home interior .
p5204
aVYou can test drive a Foscam FI8918W camera installed in Russia at this link : -LRB- ... -RRB- Login using Server Push Mode as user demo and a password of demo .
p5205
aVYou can fully control the pan\u005c/tilt .
p5206
aVPersonally , I recommend that you never use the ActiveX mode - it is , in my opinion , buggy .
p5207
aVAll of the Foscam cameras come with infrared LEDs built-in the camera face .
p5208
aVThis enables night vision in black  white .
p5209
aVThe FI8904W model is particularly good at seeing in the dark , given its large array of infrared LEDs .
p5210
aVThe manufacturer claims 20 meters of visibility .
p5211
aVI can say that a pitch black 20x20 foot room will appear as if the room lights are on in the FI8904W 's video .
p5212
aVThe builtin software enables multiple cameras to be linked through its built-in web page , creating a single monitoring center for multiple cameras .
p5213
aVA demonstration of this feature can be seen on YouTube at : -LRB- ... -RRB- One issue is that to save cost , Foscam cameras lack the switchable infrared filter found in more expensive IP network cameras .
p5214
aVAs a result , the colors of images and videos will not be true , primarily concerning the color green .
p5215
aVPlant foliage will appear gray .
p5216
aVGiven the camera 's security goal , this is n't a big issue to me .
p5217
aVAll Foscam cameras have built-in software supporting a motion detector feature that can be scheduled by day of week and time of day , in fifteen minute increments .
p5218
aVWhen active , detected motion will cause six time stamped -LRB- in the filename -RRB- still photographs of what caused the motion to be emailed to the email address of your choice .
p5219
aVIt supports access to smtp mail servers , such as Yahoo but not SSL servers , such as Gmail .
p5220
aVLastly , configuring any network IP camera , not just Foscam , is not plug and play and Foscam 's little instruction booklet is minimal .
p5221
aVHelp exists on Internet forums like -LRB- ... -RRB-

VMy kodak easyshare z612 6.1 mp digital camera is exactly what i was looking for .
p5224
aVI spent six months looking , reading , surfing the web , paying layaway on some other ditigal camera .
p5225
aVOn the month of Dec. i picked up some ads on the z612 , read them , research the camera , close my layaway on the other ditigal camera , bought my kodak z612 at amazon .
p5226
aVThe camera is macro compatible , small , light , and offers me a chance to learn a more modern aspect on photography .
p5227
aa(lp5228
VThis was a great camera while it was working , and I have always trusted the Kodak brand .
p5229
aVSadly , my camera just stopped after 9 months .
p5230
aVYes , I tried new batteries , but that was not the answer .
p5231
aVI talked to a few other people about the same model , and they also had this problem .
p5232
aVI will never buy an Easyshare again .
p5233
aa(lp5234
VThis camera is extremely easy to use .
p5235
aVThe touch screen menu feature is great for gadget freaks and newbies alike .
p5236
aVThe autofocus is very fast and the LCD screen is crystal clear .
p5237
aVI managed to get 10 photos on the 8mb memory stick that comes with the camera which is fine if you plan to use this camera primarily as a video camera .
p5238
aVIt 's small design means it can be tucked out of the way on outings and whipped out at a moments notice .
p5239
aVMy battery lasts around 74 minutes and the Infolitium system , which tells you exactly how much power is left in minutes rather than the usual 3 bars , is really helpful .
p5240
aVIt can be a little noisy when rewinding a tape or changing modes but you dont hear anything while taping or reviewing .
p5241
aVIt 's small , sleek and really fun to use .
p5242
aVI got this as a gift but if I were buying one for myself , this would be the one I would choose .
p5243
aa(lp5244
VI did a LOT of research to see which camera would be best for my boyfriend .
p5245
aVThis camera is GREAT for the price !
p5246
aVHe likes the color and the pictures it takes !
p5247
aa(lp5248
VI bought my camera July 25 , 2010 .
p5249
aVIt froze while taking a picture on Oct 10 , 2010 .
p5250
aVI have heard terrible things about their customer service .
p5251
aVI will buy a new camera -LRB- Not A Nikon !!!!! -RRB-
p5252
aVand try again .
p5253
aVI would not recommend this camera to anyone -LRB- although for the time it worked it did take nice pictures -RRB- .
p5254
aa(lp5255
VI bought this for mounting my Kodak Zi6 video camera , however it 's pretty much useless as is .
p5256
aVThe slope of the windshield prevents the camera from being mounted upright .
p5257
aVI have to hang the camera upside down and then rotate the video in editing software , which causes it to look like I 'm driving on the left side of the road -LRB- the wrong side here in the U.S. -RRB- .
p5258
aVI have a Ford Edge , which would have a pretty standard windshield slope I 'd think .
p5259
aVApparently there 's an extension arm that is needed , but it 's not included with the mount and there 's no mention of this from Amazon .
p5260
aVIf you have a camera with a connector on the top , then this might be ok , but if you 're planning on mounting a standard handheld camera , which normally would connect on the bottom , then you 're out of luck .
p5261
aVThe product is well made , but the issue of needing an extension arm for many cameras is irritating -LRB- especially since I could n't even find the extension on the Panavise website -RRB- .
p5262
aa(lp5263
VIf I could give a rating of 0 I would .
p5264
aVI had this camera for about 3.5 months and maybe 30 minutes of recordings .
p5265
aVI got the `` DEW DETECTED '' message and this camera has been useless since then .
p5266
aVI would not recommend this camera to anyone .
p5267
aVSave your money .
p5268
aa(lp5269
VMy grandson was always borrowing my camera when we took them on trips .
p5270
aVHe learned how to use it with no problem .
p5271
aVI bought him his own for Christmas -LRB- charged it and put it back in the box -RRB- so when he opened it he could take pictures immediately .
p5272
aVHe had a blast Christmas morning .
p5273
aa(lp5274
VEasy to install , network , and view online .
p5275
aVCareful using staples to secure wiring , I damaged one cable and had to get another but the company sent one no charge .
p5276
aVDefender customer service rocks .
p5277
aa(lp5278
VHere 's the deal .
p5279
aVThis camera is simply a lot of fun .
p5280
aVI have many cameras from point-and-shoot to DSLR , and each one does something really well .
p5281
aVThis one is my `` take with me on a quick trip to the Rocky Mountains and have a lot of fun camera '' .
p5282
aVI have captured some really great images with this camera .
p5283
aVOf course , it is not a DSLR and does not perform like a DSLR .
p5284
aVIt will never be as fast as a DSLR .
p5285
aVThe images can be as good as some mid-level DSLRs if you take your time with the shot .
p5286
aVRemember that cameras do n't take pictures .
p5287
aVPhotographers take pictures .
p5288
aa(lp5289
VI purchased this camera just before my wedding and vacation to Las Vegas .
p5290
aVEasy to use , very good quality pictures , simple to download photos on to my computer .
p5291
aa(lp5292
VOver the years I am owned may cameras , but this one bets them all .
p5293
aVIt has very good picture quality and works extremely well in dim light .
p5294
aa(lp5295
VBought this as a Christmas present for our 5.5 year old .
p5296
aVHe loves taking pictures and I prefer the digital to the print .
p5297
aVButtons are easy to push and it takes clean pictures .
p5298
aVThe only downside is that it uses AA batteries , but buy some rechargeable AAs and you 'll be fine .
p5299
aa(lp5300
VI got 2 uses out of this camera before water damage .
p5301
aVI know there are some mentally challenged people who probably dont close it correctly or change memory cards in\u005c/near water so they have to have that fineprint `` no warranty for water damage disclaimer '' This was a one and done .
p5302
aVCharged battery , used it one day , worked next day then died after third picture .
p5303
aVPoor performance from a usually reliable manufacturer .
p5304
aVNice job Fuji , will never buy or recommend your product again
p5305
aa(lp5306
VAfter reading reviews here and watching some video reviews on youtube , I ordered this product the Toshiba Camileo S30 Full HD Camcorder from Amazon .
p5307
aVThe product arrived in retail package , with every little gadget in the box , a camcorder , a charger , a mini HDMI cable , a composite cable , a mini USB cable , a tripod , a string and a wipe .
p5308
aV-LRB- Not like some one said that Amazon sell it in a stripped version -RRB- However the unit I received is a defect one .
p5309
aVThere is a piece of rubbeer stuck inside the SD car slot .
p5310
aVIt 's difficult to insert SD card .
p5311
aVAnd when I managed to push the card in , it 's more difficult to pull it out .
p5312
aVWorse still , my SD card is covered with glue when I pull it out from the camcorder .
p5313
aVI guess it comes from that piece of rubber which should n't be there .
p5314
aVIt 's a obvious assembly failure .
p5315
aVI played with the camcorder for a few minutes before put it back in the return box .
p5316
aVThe video and sound is OK .
p5317
aV-LRB- My expectation is pretty low , by the way -RRB- .
p5318
aVIt 's easy to hold in hand , except that you might cover the LED light under the lenses .
p5319
aVThe operation is intuitive .
p5320
aVBut the screen is so cheaply built that it looks like my first Nokia 10 years ago .
p5321
aVAnyway , I 'm sending it back .
p5322
aVBy the way , I 'll give Amazon customer service a 5-star rating .
p5323
aVI complained that my SD card has been ruined by the camcorder .
p5324
aVThey let me choose one on the website and give it to me for free .
p5325
aa(lp5326
VGreat portable still camera .
p5327
aVThe zoom is a delight .
p5328
aVI was able to take pictures of my wife from 1\u005c/2 mile away , using a tripod , and you can clearly see her face .
p5329
aVI was pleasantly surprised by the GPS feature .
p5330
aVI was only looking for a good pocket zoom camera , but the GPS is a neat feature .
p5331
aVSo far , it has done a good job of tagging the picture locations .
p5332
aVThe HD videos are adequate , but the sound recording is not , and there is no ability to add an external microphone .
p5333
aa(lp5334
VI am not entirely sure what all of the negative reviews are about but since I have not shot with the S95 I can not attest to the quality from that perspective .
p5335
aVI absolutely love the camera so far and am extremely pleased with my purchase .
p5336
aVThere are so many manual adjustments that can be made which is huge for me since I sold my DSLR due to its bulky size .
p5337
aVThis thing looks and feels great , and has the quality to match .
p5338
aa(lp5339
VI was worried about the price but its worth every penny .
p5340
aVDid all my research and looked around and this definitely is clearly the best camera out there as of 4\u005c/1\u005c/2011 .
p5341
aVLow light photos are the best .
p5342
aVI have n't seen indoor low light pictures this beautiful before .
p5343
aVWas thinking of a DSLR but felt its not worth the learning curve nor the bulky size .
p5344
aVIf you can get that DSLR quality at a fraction of the size and complexity , who would n't prefer the compact .
p5345
aVFinally , great choice and its my Best purchase ever .
p5346
aVGo Canon .
p5347
aVNote : Do n't get fooled by 10.0 MP while you see 15MP one 's out there .
p5348
aVThat 's all a myth .
p5349
aVGoto dpreview etc and research about the megapixel myths .
p5350
aVWhen you go to a store , look at the f\u005c/2 .0 numbers and there is n't one out there in a compact camera that 's close to 2.0 .
p5351
aVLot 's of 2.5 's and 2.3 .
p5352
aa(lp5353
VI went out trying to search for a professional camera i could use to upgrade my films .
p5354
aVThis camera is expensive , but the least expensive as far as professional camera 's go .
p5355
aVAfter receiving this item , the first thing you will notice is it feels cheaply made .
p5356
aVI mean it feels like a toy camera .
p5357
aVThe camera is also very old , my 200 dollar camera has more advance options then this .
p5358
aVThe lcd screen is way to small and the giant viewfinder on the top is unnecessary in size and gets it the way of the lcd screen ... very annoying .
p5359
aVThe camera also produces low grade looking quality for the price .
p5360
aVThe camera in no way compares to some hd cameras .
p5361
aVSounds very poor also .
p5362
aVI bought this camera and made a thousand dollar mistake , if i were you i would not buy it .
p5363
aVIn the end i sold the camera back for $ 340 ... I bought it for $ 1300 ... .
p5364
aVi lost a lot of money .
p5365
aVI bought a rebel t3i yesterday for 800 dollars and even though i sold the panasonic and lost a lot of money it was the best decision i made to get rid of it .
p5366
aVill save you the trouble do n't buy it !!!!
p5367
aa(lp5368
VDurable , clear view , very light , pretty powerful for their size , very compact .
p5369
aVI 've used these while camping for extended periods and basic day trips .
p5370
aVThe magnification is n't mind blowing , but definitely helps .
p5371
aVNo real complaints that I can think of , but I 'm not a big expert on binos .
p5372
aVI wish they were more powerful and still the same size and weight , but pretty sure I 'd have to shell out more cash .
p5373
aVBang for buck I 'm pretty darn happy .
p5374
aa(lp5375
VBought this as a gift - very disappointed when it only worked for 10 minutes !!
p5376
aVI had read the reviews where others had stated that it would shut off and not turn back on but since i had a Kodak of my own decided to purchase it .
p5377
aVDO N'T !!
p5378
aVIt 's now on its way back to Amazon .
p5379
aVWill not purchase another Kodak product .
p5380
aa(lp5381
VI always wanted a compact camera to bring on travels and family visits that had good picture quality and good zoom range .
p5382
aVComing from high range APS-C Nikons I know what I want and what to expect .
p5383
aVAnd the P7000 delivered .
p5384
aVPicture quality is great , shutter lack good for a compact -LRB- remember this is not a DSLR -RRB- , focus speed is good - not very fast , I am very impressed with the auto white balance - it beats my D300 on acuracy .
p5385
aVSize is good - not too small and not too big .
p5386
aVUser interface is good for a Nikon user .
p5387
aVMy only complaint is the quality of the multi function wheel .
p5388
aVThe ` feel ' quality of the wheel is not good enough for a Nikon at that price .
p5389
aVIt is too easy to adjust settings by mistake .
p5390
aVSo ALWAYS CHECK SETTINGS MADE BY THE WHEEL BEFORE SHOOTING .
p5391
aVWould I recommend the P7000 to a freind ?
p5392
aVAbsolutely - but keep the little problem with the multi function wheel in mind .
p5393
aa(lp5394
VThe Bloggie 3D camera is an interesting idea , but I am not sure it has a place in the average house hold .
p5395
aVIt offers all the same features of a standard Bloggie , but adds a second lens for the 3d feature at almost double the price .
p5396
aVKeep in mind that viewing the 3D images off the device requires a 3DTV , red blue3D glasses and an HDMI cable that is not provided .
p5397
aVI am not a camera expert so this is an average person 's take : Pros : Separate buttons for video and picture makes it very easy to operate Flip-out USB connection is nice , no cables to worry about The shell has a rubbery feel that make it easy to grip with no slipping out of your hands Very easy to copy pictures and video off the device and the included software makes sharing very simple The quality of the 3D video is very good for the class of device when you have good lighting 8GB of internal storage is not bad for the device 's intended purpose Cons : No lens cover 3D view screen is poor and can really be stressful on the eyes 3D video kills the battery in about an hour Low-light performance is very poor in both pictures and video There is no inexpensive way to edit 3D images or video HDMI cable is not provided , costing an extra $ 30 Red\u005c/Blue glasses required In conclusion I think it is important to realize this really is not a device for the average person .
p5398
aVIf you are a blogger or anyone that is serious about uploading a lot of video and\u005c/or images and want to add some 3D flair then this is an okay choice , but there are other devices out there that handle 3D better for the same price point .
p5399
aVIf you just want to take some video of the family then this is not a good choice .
p5400
aa(lp5401
VNothing but trouble .
p5402
aVSent to repair shop 3 tmes in 7 months .
p5403
aVSharp even replaced first camera .
p5404
aVBoth only lasted 80-90 days before eating tapes .
p5405
aVSharp does not back up their product either .
p5406
aVI would recommend a JVC .
p5407
aa(lp5408
VI had a dmc zs3 camera for a few years and loved it .
p5409
aVIt went everywhere I did and worked well in virtually any setting .
p5410
aVIt spent 2 weeks going down the Colorado river , skiing trips , 10 degree nights in the desert , HD video taping on the dash of the truck while 4-wheeling , concerts , parties , you name it ... and it worked great , until it died when the focus gear stripped out -LRB- fixable I hear , parts available on ebay -RRB- .
p5411
aVWell , I spent hours and hours reading reviews for a replacement camera that could replace my mighty little zs3 knowing that there was fierce competition in the under $ 300 category and ended up getting the zs7 simply because I already had the extra batteries , cables and waterproof Pelican case that would fit it .
p5412
aVAnd I got it despite what some reviews said about the supposed diminished photo quality from the zs3 model .
p5413
aVWell , it 's only worse than the zs3 if you do n't tinker with the Noise , Contrast , Sharpness and Saturation settings .
p5414
aVOnce you tinker with them a little the pictures are outstanding for a pocket camera .
p5415
aVYou will never go back to a 35mm lense once you see you can get a whole room in one shot with its 25mm wide angle Leica lense .
p5416
aVThe flash is enough to light up a living room and the auto focus features ensure subjects are usually in focus .
p5417
aVThe HD video is perfect for recording everything from nature scenes to rock concerts and the stereo sound quality is good enough to play on your stereo and not wince .
p5418
aVBattery life is pretty good for a camera that does so many automatic things like IR and continuous autofocus .
p5419
aVAVCHD is very good for putting hours of quality HD video on a 16GB SDHC card ... but be sure to get a Class 6 or higher card or you will have buffer issues writing at the HD video speed .
p5420
aVThere are MANY menu settings as this camera does about everything a picky amateur photographer could want IF you just bother to mess with the settings until you find what you like .
p5421
aVI rarely use the Intelligent Auto mode as the Program , Apeture priority , Shutter priority and manual modes prove superior .
p5422
aVSeeing as my passport arrived a few days ago I will not hesitate for a moment to put this in a backpack -LRB- inside its Pelican case , along with the waterproof Olympus as a backup -RRB- and go to another country for a week with it being sure it will perform well .
p5423
aVSpend the extra $ 49 for the Square Deal 3 year unlimited warranty as you will surely be depressed if anything happens to this camera and leaves you without ... It 's THAT good ... ...
p5424
aa(lp5425
VNot much to add the many positive reviews .
p5426
aVQuality of image and portability tops the list .
p5427
aa(lp5428
VI have had 3 Canon Point and shoot cameras before .
p5429
aVMy last camera was a SD630 and broke when is was dropped .
p5430
aVI ordered the Canon SD1400IS based on Consumer Reports review .
p5431
aVThe camera has many more functions than the Sd630 .
p5432
aVWith so mant functions , I need to refer to the User Guide for instructions on how to set up the features .
p5433
aVThe bad news is the 170 page user guide is in pdf format and you need a computer handy to read the guide .
p5434
aVYou can print it but it is 170 pagers in 8 x 10 pages .
p5435
aVI do n't carry a PC on vacation and absolutely will not carry 170 8x10 pages either .
p5436
aVWhat is the use of making a very small camera but have the UG so large ?
p5437
aVI understand Canon is cutting costs but had I known about the lack of handy pocket user guide , I would have chosen another model or brand .
p5438
aa(lp5439
VThe only real problem I had with this camera after buying it was that it does not come with a memory card , and the lack of one is not something apparent to a customer without close examination of the box .
p5440
aVMemory cards are n't expensive , but it was a bit of a let down to know that I 'd have to wait to use my camera until a card arrived in the mail a few days later , or I went out to buy one .
p5441
aa(lp5442
VI have taken four or five rolls of photos and the colors are bad .
p5443
aVThey are mostly too bright or fogged out .
p5444
aVThe pics come out a little better with the zoom , zoomed .
p5445
aVI sadly gave it to my mom , istead of blowing it up .
p5446
aVWe bought a Sigma Sa-9 and feel much better on quality .
p5447
aa(lp5448
VThis was a great buy .
p5449
aVIR camera with the ability to do audio , video and picture .
p5450
aVBattery life few hours constant use w\u005c/IR -LRB- little short -RRB- , recharge time is not to bad .
p5451
aa(lp5452
VAs always Sony made good products for electronics fans like me .
p5453
aVI loved this camera with all the features that bring to you unlimited posibilities to create pictures , movies in 2D or 3D .
p5454
aVIt is amazing how the technology is going every year giving you peace of mind and creativity .
p5455
aa(lp5456
VIn direct comparison to a few other small zoom binoculars , I found these to be quite acceptable except for one thing ... their inward travel is insufficient for narrow eye separation distances ... I could use another 1\u005c/8 '' or so .
p5457
aV-LRB- I returned mine for that reason alone -RRB- I am aware that my eyes are somewhat narrow , but I had another person check them out and they were to wide for his eyes as well .
p5458
aVOtherwise , the view is good and bright and their ability to keep focus between zooming was better than some higher priced models I have recently looked at .
p5459
aVAfter experiencing the slowness of their electronic zoom , I would probably prefer a well made manual zoom , assuming that the zoom knob was located in the right spot ... some are not .
p5460
aVIf your eyes are somewhat normal in their distance separation , You will probably be happy with the purchase .
p5461
aa(lp5462
VThe optics are truly amazing for the price .
p5463
aVThe field is wide , the image is bright , razor sharp and with fine contrast and color rendition .
p5464
aVMy complaint is with the center focusing mechanism which tends to drift and requires constant attention .
p5465
aVThis problem could have been easily fixed at the factory with a properly sized washer to take out the play in the center focusing knob .
p5466
aVI hope Celestron gets the message and takes the last small step to make these binoculars just right .
p5467
aa(lp5468
VNext to BEAR the Canon S90 is always with me .
p5469
aVAnd no one seems to notice , which works out perfectly for any Sherlockian sleuth .
p5470
aVYou will need to carry around a backup battery to be safe - not much of a hardship .
p5471
aVA very easy to use camera that produces great pictures particularly if you do n't use the flash .
p5472
aVTremendous fun camera for the traveler .
p5473
aa(lp5474
VI 've had 4 digital cameras before this one ; this easily takes the best pictures , has a very short lag between shots , has a long battery life , and takes fantastic videos with sound up to 1gb in length .
p5475
aVI took it on a family vacation and had 13 relatives standing around the computer marvelling at the video quality .
p5476
aVGreat value at ~ $ 300 .
p5477
aa(lp5478
VThere is just one word to describe this camera AMAZING .
p5479
aVUnderwater feature works incredibly well .
p5480
aVThe zoom sucks , practically no zoom .
p5481
aVI did n't like the design of it , i like the TX1 design better .
p5482
aVBut definately worth the money .
p5483
aa(lp5484
VI 've got this from somewhere else .
p5485
aVBut Amazon 's price is cheaper than what I have paid .
p5486
aVOverall features are great .
p5487
aVHowever a Firewire connection to the PC will make it perfect in case you do a lot of digital imaging stuffs .
p5488
aVAlso , would take a little time to know how to use it .
p5489
aa(lp5490
VI was glad to see all the sports fans reporting their satisfaction with these binocs .
p5491
aVIt sounds as if they will come in handy .
p5492
aVBaseball season is almost here .
p5493
aVI have spent small fortunes on binoculars for bird watching , but since my GS broke my last pair -LRB- my fault for letting a 5YO wear them while running , which is his MO , after all -RRB- , I could n't bring myself to pay so much for another pair .
p5494
aVMy expectations were very low for these .
p5495
aVThey are wonderful .
p5496
aVThe field of view is excellent .
p5497
aVI am amazed at how close they focus and how bright they are .
p5498
aVThey are a little heavier than I expected , but I think I will get used to that .
p5499
aVI am very pleased with these .
p5500
aVI have n't done much birding lately .
p5501
aVI have a big smile on my face in expectation of my next outing .
p5502
aa(lp5503
VAs for how well this camera works , it 's great .
p5504
aVHOWEVER , Polaroid is discontinuing manufacture and sale of its instant cameras and film .
p5505
aVSo keep that in mind when you purchase .
p5506
aVThe price may drop if you really must get one .
p5507
aVAlso , Target sells them for $ 40 , so I have NO CLUE why they are so expensive here .
p5508
aVBut anyway , I was about to buy one myself but I think I 'll skip it now .
p5509
aa(lp5510
VThese are replacements for my trusty but funny looking Nikon Travelites which were seriously dropped .
p5511
aVI use them mostly for sporting events -LRB- football and the like -RRB- , concerts , casual birding , a bit of night sky scanning and on the water at Lake Tahoe on ocassion .
p5512
aVThe Monarchs are rugged , extremely bright , have excellent optics -LRB- that 3D effect -RRB- and unlike other reviewers I actually like the captive lens caps - no problems here .
p5513
aVI also like the ability to easily view with -LRB- sun -RRB- glasses on , something really lacking with my old pair .
p5514
aVI am however still trying to get used to the larger form factor .
p5515
aVThe Travelites while not as bright or sharp were small enough to fit into a fanny pack , on a belt or even in a front pocket if needed , While not huge like a full sized set the 8X42 Monarchs though compact remain `` something to carry '' even if the case is a pretty good one .
p5516
aVI find when hiking that I now slide them in the case into a small day pack rather than sling the short strap .
p5517
aVThis size vs. performance was a planned trade off and I am not unhappy one bit with my choice expecially with the rock bottom Amazon price and the Nikon mail in rebate on top !
p5518
aVThese are a step up for me .
p5519
aVExcellent !
p5520
aa(lp5521
Vi hate the item i wish i could send it back but my hubby lost the recipt everything is blurry and i try to hold as still as i can dont buy not happy t all
p5522
aa(lp5523
VWhat an amazing camera !
p5524
aVI am just now moving into amateur\u005c/hobbyist photography .
p5525
aVMy setup : Rebel XT , 1GB SanDisk CF , 28-135mm \u005c/ 3.5-5 .6 IS Canon , and 50mm\u005c/1 .8 Canon -LRB- fixed -RRB- for low-light indoors shots .
p5526
aVAfter printing several vacation shots on my Canon PIXMA iP5000 , I can not tell a difference from 35mm film even after close scrutiny .
p5527
aVMy choice was between Digital Rebel XT or Nikon D70 .
p5528
aVWhat sold me on the Canon was the lens selections , particularly the image stabilization feature .
p5529
aVI concur with the other reviewers : the IS lenses are amazing .
p5530
aVFor example : outdoor night shot 1\u005c/5 sec at 100mm on ISO 400 and no tripod - NO BLUR .
p5531
aVDo n't ask me how this is possible , but it worked .
p5532
aVI got some amazing nighttime photos of the city skyline in Nassau , Bahamas , long after the sun went down .
p5533
aVThings I liked : - phenomenal picture quality , even in very low light - aesthetics .
p5534
aVyes , i 'm vain ... - fast shutter response - good built-in flash - excellent lenses -LRB- esp .
p5535
aV28-135mm \u005c/ 3.5-5 .6 IS ! -RRB-
p5536
aV- nice menu shortcut buttons on rear panel - ability to shoot RAW - 1GB CF holds ~ 260 finest JPEG photos Small complaints - brightest LCD setting still dark in sunlight - auto white balance gets it wrong once in a while - white balance modes are just so-so in my experience Unless you are an extremely discriminating photography professional , I can not imagine you would be displeased with this camera .
p5537
aVFor the money , you 'll probably not find a better camera .
p5538
aVHappy shooting ,
p5539
aa(lp5540
VAfter being an exceptionally satisfied owner of a semi-automatic Canon camera , I expected to find the same level of satisfaction with my purchase of a Canon Z135 zoom camera .
p5541
aVWhile the camera performs adequately well in taking quality outdoor photos , it falls far behind in flash photography .
p5542
aVWhile advertised as having a red-eye reduction capability , I have found red-eye to be an ongoing problem and existing in every photo where people or animals are photographed .
p5543
aVI am extremely disappointed in the performance of this camera in the price range where it is sold .
p5544
aVI would expect this level of quality to be acceptable only in a camera costing much less .
p5545
aVI have owned this camera for two years and have discontinued using it because of the frustration I feel when my prints are returned and do not meet my level of expectation .
p5546
aVI should have done more research before buying this product where most of my selection was based on the Canon name .
p5547
aa(lp5548
VA very nice camera , small enough to put in your pocket .
p5549
aVHas many modes to make it easy to get good pictures in all settings .
p5550
aVOnly problem I had was remembering to wait for the green box to appear after pushing down on shutter button half way , before pushing all the way to take the picture .
p5551
aVI use Alkaline batteries , and I take a lot of pictures , so it seems like I go through a set of batteries at least one per day .
p5552
aVI am very pleased with the camera .
p5553
aV10x optical zoom is great .
p5554
aVUsed it on 7 day Europe river cruise and took between 800 and 900 pictures and they were great .
p5555
aVStrongly recommend this camera .
p5556
aa(lp5557
VChose this camera over other like ones for a few reasons .
p5558
aV1 -RRB- was one of only a few that was waterproof and shock proof and with little ones running around that was a good feature .
p5559
aV2 -RRB- the price was very competitive compared to others that seemed to have less capability .
p5560
aV3 -RRB- it was carried at other large , well-known electronics stores and smaller specialty stores so my perception of that was that the overall product was very professional and solid .
p5561
aVTook to a vacation in Florida with family and it worked great for filming the kids at a water park , amusement park , etc. .
p5562
aVdid n't use H2O feature or submerge , but knowing I was safe to take in the pool for good close-ups of the kids vs. standing on the edge and zooming was a plus .
p5563
aVI even took it on a roller coaster at Busch Gardens and just held on for dear life so as to not drop it ... was last run of day so a bit dark , but will try this again in better light and am sure it will be a cool video .
p5564
aVHooked up to TV and even on 720 @ 60 fps the video looked really good .
p5565
aVMUCH better than my $ 900 5 year old canon video camera during TV playback .
p5566
aVOnly issues .
p5567
aVI had it freeze up a few times and only way to re-set was to take battery out .
p5568
aVDid n't see that much in other reviews , so maybe I was doing something wrong .
p5569
aVEither way , returned it for a new unit .
p5570
aVno problems since .
p5571
aVAlso , the LCD screen is quite small , but i did n't have too much trouble keeping the subjects in there .
p5572
aVZoom is not great , but did n't expect it to be on a unit at this price and size .
p5573
aVLow light is a bit of a challenge , but again , did n't expect it to be great given the size of the lens .
p5574
aVUnknown right now is how do I burn all of these little clips onto a DVD to play back in succession .
p5575
aVRight now when plugged in to TV , you need to use the cameras buttons to play each clip separately as you do if watching just on the LCD for playback .
p5576
aVI have a Mac and simply put the memory card into a card reader and the files uploaded with no problem to my iPhoto library .
p5577
aVNice thing is with being small individual files , adding them to an email , or Facebook , etc will be a breeze .
p5578
aVI am running a 16GB memory card in it with a `` 6 '' speed capability and at 720 @ 60fps I am getting about 2.5 hours of available recording time .
p5579
aVCan go up to 32 GB card in unit but they are very pricey still .
p5580
aVI paid about $ 45 for the 16GB card .
p5581
aVMake sure you get one with at least a 4-6 speed rating for video recording .
p5582
aVYou will pay a bit more for that .
p5583
aVAll in all , I think I will replace my large video camera with this camera full time until i spring for an HD video camera with full features down the road .
p5584
aVThe portability and capabilities of this camera are better than my 5 year old Canon as i mentioned before so no need to lug that thing around until something better lands at my doorstep .
p5585
aVStill pics look great too and takes just about 2 seconds to change from video to still photo mode .
p5586
aVGreat product !
p5587
aa(lp5588
VFirst , they should mention that this camcorder has 120x digital zoom , as well .
p5589
aVI got the DVD92 for Christmas , and was a little unhappy with the picture quality , so I traded up to this one .
p5590
aVNo comparison !
p5591
aVThe video and still quality is superior to anything else I 've seen , and the 5.1 sound adds that something extra .
p5592
aVNow I 'm only waiting for higher data-capacity mini-DVDs !
p5593
aa(lp5594
VThe camera is exactly what I was looking for .
p5595
aVI had already purchased this exact camera and was buying as a gift .
p5596
aVThe pictures are great .
p5597
aVIf you take time to work with the settings you can get really great images .
p5598
aVI was also please with the cost .
p5599
aa(lp5600
VAfter struggling with this camera for several hours and several phone calls to JVC customer support and Best Buy customer support , I found out that the JVC GZ-MG130 camcorder is not truly compatible with the iMac .
p5601
aVJVC said the problem is that the MG130 does not have a firewire port .
p5602
aVYou can only hook it up to the iMac via USB and transfer the camera 's video MOD file to the iMac .
p5603
aVIf you try to open it on the iMac , you get an export error message saying `` QuickTime could n't parse it : -2048 '' .
p5604
aVSo you have to purchase additional video editing software -LRB- either capty or pixela -RRB- in order to play and edit the video MOD file .
p5605
aVThose apps will then convert the file to MPEG-2 , which you can burn .
p5606
aViMovie requires MPEG-4 , and you would have to buy additional software to convert the JVC file into that format , but I assume it would take several hours to convert an hour of camcorder video this way .
p5607
aVUnfortunately , I found all this out too late to return the camcorder .
p5608
aVNote that there is nothing in the user manual , JVC 's website , or on the product box to tell you about these problems .
p5609
aVThe salesmen are trained to tell you that the camcorder works with a Mac , which is really a bald-faced lie .
p5610
aVWhen I complained to JVC about that , they refused to accept responsibility and simply apologized for my loss .
p5611
aa(lp5612
VSimple , not too bad , really , but ... External mic , yes !
p5613
aVBought it , spent a night filming old super 8 -LRB- mm -RRB- archive film adding comments , only to find out afterwards there was no sound , because the external mic : 1 .
p5614
aVmust be a condenser mic 2 .
p5615
aVneeds its own power supply 3 .
p5616
aVca n't exceed 3 meters .
p5617
aVCalled Canon customer support -LRB- around 6:50 on 8\u005c/13 -RRB- , and I was told : 1 .
p5618
aVthose kinds of mics are common and inexpensive -LRB- yet , somehow Radioshack does n't carry any and laughed at me , Wal-Mart scratched their head and wondered , etc. -RRB- 2 .
p5619
aVwell , we did n't really mislead you -- even though we `` forgot '' to mention it in the specs -LRB- like : `` oh , I told you the car runs on gasoline -- I just forgot to mention it 's a specially mixed diesel ... sorry ! '' -RRB-
p5620
aV3 .
p5621
aVit was in the manual so it 's your own dumb fault , sorry 4 .
p5622
aVI 'm not going to do anything , sorry you do n't ever want to choose Canon again .
p5623
aVThanks , guys !
p5624
aV: -LRB- Sony , I never should have left you !!

VI purchased the camera as a gift for my husband in July of 2002 .
p5627
aVAs new parents , we expected that we would want a camcorder to record important moments in our children 's infancy and toddlerhood .

aa(lp5652
VI bought this camera a year ago after a long line of Nikon ownership .
p5653
aVFirst the F series -LRB- still have my F-3 -RRB- , then the 5400 point and shoot , The D-100 , The D-70 and finally the D-200 .
p5654
aVNikon 's digital progression has been excellent and I must say that all of the Nikon digital camera bodies I have owned have held a reasonable value when upgrading to the next in the line .
p5655
aVThis body is everything that you would expect in a `` pro-sumer '' camera from them that incorporates features and benefits from their higher end pro models .
p5656
aVIf you like Nikon , you 'll LOVE this camera .
p5657
aVI have also converted most of my lenses to the D series and have been quite pleased .
p5658
aVMy only complaint about the D series lenses is that most are F 3.5-5 .6 so they are not particularly `` fast '' lenses .
p5659
aVThey make up for it in their superb , distortion and chromatic abberation free quality .
p5660
aVThe bonus here -- as you likely already know is that all of your old , manual lenses still fit and are fun to experiment with at their new effective focal lengths approximately 1.45 x their original .
p5661
aV-LRB- okay , I know I should dump my old F 2.0 20mm but I just ca n't even though I have the 12-24 -RRB- .
p5662
aVI highly recommend this body !
p5663
aa(lp5664
VI read all the reviews before purchasing throughout 2011 and was hesitant based on the widespread freeze up problems .
p5665
aVI concluded the firmware update probably fixed this as the number of those reviews went down later in 2011 .
p5666
aVBought it for Christmas 2011 and have been using for a few weeks -LRB- 40 videos -RRB- at home and one vacation -LRB- indoor water park -RRB- .
p5667
aVUpdated the firmware the minute I opened the box -LRB- per other reviews -RRB- .
p5668
aVIt has been working great with not a single problem .
p5669
aVTook it in the water at the water park and had no problems and great video .
p5670
aVMy only complaint -LRB- and one star reduction -RRB- was the fact that they reduced the sensor size from the previous year 's model .
p5671
aVSensor size on these types of cameras are the downside either way and to reduce it even more is a poor choice .
p5672
aVHaving said that the video quality is still very good in proper light .
p5673
aVI used 1080p for all but a few `` normal vacation '' videos and am very happy with the quality .
p5674
aVThe quality seems to go above my expectations on the macro setting , will use that more this spring\u005c/summer .
p5675
aVConclusion : for $ 100 and waterproof 1080p\u005c/720p HD video on the fly and to share - this camera ca n't be beat .
p5676
aVIf you are looking for a better sensor for low light shooting , and better sound - buy the correct product which is a higher end HD camcorder .
p5677
aa(lp5678
VGood Gosh , some of the whining on this feedback forum is insane ... example ... about having to buy a usb extension cord , under $ 5 bucks , some usb ports are not as accessable as others ... dont buy these products if your so clueless you dont understand that it is not a life changing event to get a inexspensive longer cord

aVI was hoping that we would get to go for another trip to Peru for my birthday , but , alas , finances ... For my consolation prize , I finally upgraded to a true dSLR - the Nikon D7000 DSLR to go with my lenses -LRB- mainly Nikkor -RRB- .

aVI used a hand-held light meter and had to set the shutter speed manually for that .
p5704
aVAnyway , back to the D7000 .
p5705
aVIt has an shutter speed from 1\u005c/8 ,000 th -LRB- !!! -RRB-
p5706
aVof a second all the way to the equivalent to cable release .
p5707
aVYou do need a remote to take full advantage of this .
p5708
aVHolding the shutter button down manually or even just pressing twice can cause all kinds of havoc on long exposures .
p5709
aVThe `` bulb '' setting allows you to totally override the shutter speed regardless of lighting conditions .
p5710
aVThis camera will do pretty much anything an old-school film SLR can do .
p5711
aVIt has about every bell and whistle you can imagine or want .
p5712
aVSo far I have been happy with the results and the images are clear and sharp .
p5713
aVI have yet to take full advantage of everything .
p5714
aVIn the half-week I have been playing with it , I have shot in aperature-priority mode for pretty much all of my shots .
p5715
aVI have played with the D-lighting , ev values , and a couple of other features .
p5716
aVI am really excited about trying out the continuous high-speed mode -LRB- up to 100 photos by holding down the shutter - you wo n't have to worry about camera shake at 1\u005c/8 ,000 th of a second !
p5717
aVlol -RRB- and the strobe-effect flash .
p5718
aVI might try to see if the two options can be done at high shutter speeds .
p5719
aVThe only downsides that I have found so far are that it is DX-format -LRB- not really its fault , it is what it is -RRB- ; light output of flash is lame ; even at the high D-light setting ; there is really not much of an increase in contrasting detail -LRB- will have to experiment more -RRB- ; some of the commands are not intuitive -LRB- with as many options as it has , not too surprising -RRB- ; and a really weird thing happened while I was photographing the moon , Venus , and Jupiter conjuction .
p5720
aVWhen I gave the ev value a positive response -LRB- even at 0.3 ! -RRB-
p5721
aV, the moon ghosted on another part of the frame .
p5722
aV-LRB- ?!? -RRB-
p5723
aVI will have to do some research to see whether it is the camera , the lens , or maybe even just the angle of the shot .
p5724
aVThese issues are the only reasons that I did not give this 5 stars are because of the flash and the mysterious ghosting in that one series of shots .
p5725
aVIn conclusion , with the shots I have tried -LRB- and I have played with more settings than some people ever will -RRB- , this appears to be a VERY solid dSLR .
p5726
aVThis is a great dSLR and the flash is the main limiting factor for this level of camera .
p5727
aVThis can be remedied by using an SB-700 or other flash , but having to shell out more money kind of sucks .
p5728
aVI have absolutely no regrets with this purchase .
p5729
aVThe packaging was great and Amazon shipped it out quickly .
p5730
aVIt comes with nice accessories such as an eyepiece cover -LRB- useful for those long exposures -RRB- .
p5731
aVWith things like exposure lock , focus lock , white balance , being able to do post-editing within the camera -LRB- better than using outside software -RRB- , and quite a few other features , this camera will keep even the most serious amatuer happy .
p5732
aVYou might consider going for the FX version at another $ 1K , but that is the cost of a good Nikkor lens , for not THAT much of an upgrade .
p5733
aVAt that point , you might as well go for the D800E .
p5734
aVUnless you are a professional photographer , you would buy a Nikon D4 , this camera is a GREAT value for its price .
p5735
aVEnjoy and fill up that 32 gig memory card of which you can have TWO at once !!!
p5736
aVI HIGHLY , HIGHLY recommend this camera and would buy this camera again .

VI spent quite some time over the holidays looking for a cheap microscope .
p5739
aVMy primary use is looking at stamps -- and I 'm a casual user .
p5740
aVHence , I did not want to spend a lot of money on this .
p5741
aVMy only other criteria was that it should run on a Mac .
p5742
aVHaving read some of the previous reviews of this item -LRB- and many other , more expensive microscopes -RRB- I was not quite sure if it would work with my Mac .
p5743
aVHowever , at $ 40 it was low risk .
p5744
aVToday , I received the microscope and I have just installed it and tested it on a few stamps .
p5745
aVIt works perfectly and I would not hesitate to recommend this to other people looking for a cheap microscope for their Mac .
p5746
aVThe drivers are delivered on a regular size CD-ROM -LRB- as opposed to the mini that has been discussed in other reviews -RRB- .
p5747
aVThe installation is drag and drop .
p5748
aVThe software coming with the microscope may not have the greatest interface and does n't really utilize many of the Mac 's great features , but it works !
p5749
aVAlso , I could get it to work with Apple 's Photobooth .
p5750
aVThe magnification is slightly difficult to manage , but it may become easier as I 'm getting used to the microscope .
p5751
aVBottom-line , if you are looking for a low-cost microscope that is easy to install and use for casual purposes on a Mac , look no further .
p5752
aVThis is it !
p5753
aVAt $ 40 you ca n't beat it .
p5754
aa(lp5755
VThis is a limited review as I did n't get much into using the product but make of it what you will .
p5756
aVI bought this setup primarily to use for modest snowboarding .
p5757
aVUpon opening the package , I was very excited .
p5758
aVThe waterproof casing , mounts , and devices all seemed exceptionally solid and well designed .
p5759
aVThe box included two sets of instructions : one for the camera operation -LRB- in multiple languages -RRB- and one for mounting tips .
p5760
aVThe mounting tips instructions were remarkably inadequate .
p5761
aVI spent an hour trying to figure out what all the pieces were for and how to figure out the helmet strap -LRB- before realizing the strap only works for vented bicycle helmets -RRB- .
p5762
aVSo after fumbling with it to figure out a mounting strategy for my snowboarding helmet , I attempted to use the camera a bit to set up the pointing .
p5763
aVThe camera simply would not recognize a few of my SD cards .
p5764
aVI thought the cards might have been defective as I had bought them from an Amazon seller not too long ago but I loaded them into my Olympus and they worked just fine .
p5765
aVSo once I found an SD card the camera would actually recognize , I tried to do some initial filming and the camera just beeped .
p5766
aVI spent another hour troubleshooting this using the inadequate camera operation instructions which no where seemed to talk of an issue with three beeps .
p5767
aVAnyway , I finally decided to just give up and return it and requested a refund rather than a replacement .
p5768
aVMy overall impression was that the mounts and case equipment were awesome , but the glitchy camera hardly seems worth $ 300 , even though I ca n't really speak to that since I could n't get it to shoot anything .
p5769
aVIn the end I think I 'd rather just get a Flip or other cheaper HD camera and Jerry-rig my own mounts and cases -LRB- or even just continue hand held shooting -RRB- .
p5770
aVIf you 're doing stuff like surfing I realize this will be tougher as you 'll need a tight waterproof seal .
p5771

VI bought this for my 15 year old grandson for Christmas - he loves it and has had a lot of fun taking pictures of his friends and family .
p5773
aVHe posts the pictures on Facebook and has told me how much he loves the camera .
p5774
aVIt takes great pictures .
p5775
aa(lp5776
VI use this camera all the time in the pool and at the beach .
p5777
aVIt is fantastic !
p5778
aVTakes great pictures above and below the water .
p5779
aVThe camera has lots of settings for different shooting conditions that are easy to navigate .
p5780
aVMy most recent experience with it was on a 5 day hiking trip in Hawaii .
p5781
aVUnlike most of my friends who did not have water proof cameras I was able to keep my camera in easy reach in the rugged terrain .
p5782
aVWhen it rained I was the only one taking pictures .
p5783
aVAt the beach I sat it on the sand to put snorkle gear on and a big wave came and washed sand all over it -LRB- Had the Olympus floating strap attached -RRB- .
p5784
aVNo problem , just rinsed it off in the ocean and kept going .
p5785
aVOne of my friends had a cheap water proof disposable camera , not digital so cant share the pictures that easy .
p5786
aVAnother friend had a waterproof case for his camera and the extra covering over the lense caused glare on alot of the pitures .
p5787
aVAlso , he had to bother with taking the camera in and out of the case which was bulky and if any sand , dirt , or debris gets in the seal then the case is no longer water tight .
p5788
aVThis camera is a win win and well worth getting .
p5789
aa(lp5790
VI bought this product specifically for saving old 8mm family tapes .
p5791
aVWent to some video restoring places , and they charge $ 35usd and up for transferring these tapes with no editing .
p5792
aVI had a lot of them so I decided to do it myself .
p5793
aVBefore I bought it , I did my research reading a bunch of reviews in several pages for this and other sony handycam camcorders , DCRTRV460 seemed to be the right one .
p5794
aVI had a lot of doubts -LRB- compatible with windows 7 ??
p5795
aV, will the pins from fire wire connection match my computer ??
p5796
aV, do I need an specific sony software for editing ??
p5797
aV, etc , etc. . -RRB-
p5798
aVwith no answers .
p5799
aVI wanted this 8mm tapes in digital so bad , that I took the risk .
p5800
aVHonestly is great !
p5801
aVVideo editing made easy , did n't need a sony specific software , I did a quick read for some basics in the manual , downloaded Pinnacle Studio software , found a fire wire cable on Radio Shack , loaded the camera , pressed `` capture '' in my PC -LRB- Dell 64bit PC with Windows 7 -RRB- and that 's it !
p5802
aVMy only complain , important !
p5803
aV, a few of my 8mm tapes are not sony brand tapes -LRB- maxell , kodak , hitachi , etc. -RRB- and this camera would give you a real bad time trying to view non-sony brand tapes , it even broke one hitachi tape I had , but luckily for me , almost 90 % of my tapes are sony , so remember that .
p5804
aVI have n't used it for videotaping , I think is a little bit heavy for this , and a tripod is needed .
p5805
aa(lp5806
VThis camera has worked on my mind for a few years now ever since its introduction in 1999 .
p5807
aVAs a long time Nikon owner , I avioded buying one .
p5808
aVI mean it 's not the most beautiful camera in the world .
p5809
aVBut at last it began to look good to me , I mean really good and I decided I must own one .
p5810
aVBut , alas , they are nearly out of production .
p5811
aVI had to settle for a well cared for used one .
p5812
aVThe camera works like a dream .
p5813
aVThe controls are easy to locate and easy to use , even in the dark .
p5814
aVThey glow .
p5815
aVThere is a limited production still available in stainless and titanium and I think the Dynax european edition is still available if you can locate one .
p5816
aVThe limited edition sells for ahefty $ 2500 .
p5817
aVand is currently back ordered .
p5818
aVGet one if you can and the heck with anyone who tells you its not pro and ugly .

aa(lp5820
VI 've been a loyal Canon PowerShot owner since 2003 , with the S95 being my 5th such Canon compact point-and-shoot camera in a row .
p5821
aVI loved the first 3 models , and their early demises were all my fault -LRB- dropped 2 in water , and had a 3rd one stolen from my checked luggage en route to Costa Rica ... lesson learned -RRB- .
p5822
aVI loved the high quality and reliability of the pictures , and the small size made for an ideal vacation camera .
p5823
aVI was more likely to take the PowerShot everywhere I went which meant more opportunities for great pictures , as opposed to lugging around a larger , more advanced model that I could n't slide in my pocket .
p5824
aVHowever , the sx210is -LRB- the 14x optical zoom was the big selling point for me -RRB- was my first big disappointment - it had a very long shutter lag , and its auto-focus repeatedly failed to deliver .
p5825
aVI missed countless shots during a trip to South America because either the camera took too long to fire after pressing the button , or the picture would be severely blurred because the camera would fire before the auto-focus was able to finish its job .
p5826
aVIt was a huge step backwards in reliability and quality from the earlier models .
p5827
aVI recently purchased the s95 to replace the disappointing sx210 .
p5828
aVAfter working fine for 3 weeks , it started `` freaking out '' .
p5829
aVNewly charged batteries would drain very fast -LRB- within an hour -RRB- even while the camera was powered off .
p5830
aVThe flash seemed to be at the core of the issues - it ceased to extract itself when needed -LRB- yes , the flash setting was on `` auto '' -RRB- .
p5831
aVFurthermore , the camera would completely freeze \u005c/ lock-up when the flash eventually did pop-up .
p5832
aVI could n't even turn-off the camera , as the On\u005c/Off button was unresponsive - I had to wait for it to power-down on its own , after the which the problem above persisted if the flash was involved .
p5833
aVFinally , an error message stating `` flash in incorrect position , restart camera '' would occasionally pop-up , even when the flash was in the closed position .
p5834
aVNeedless to say , I 've placed a warranty call to Canon and am sending the camera in for warranty service .
p5835
aVRegardless , it 's disappointing to have had separate issues with my two most recent PowerShot purchases after having been happy with this line for so long .
p5836
aVHopefully this is not a new downward trend in product quality from Canon .
p5837
aVBut after 2 disappointments in a row , I 'll likely be looking at other brands for my next camera purchase .
p5838
aa(lp5839
VThe Nikon V1 is the ultimate second camera for DSLR owners who like to shoot moving subjects .
p5840
aVIf you are into still life almost any mirrorless camera will do , and you will probably want a larger sensor .
p5841
aVThe Sony cameras give you the largest sensor , but they do n't focus very well or very fast , they do n't meter accurately , and auto WB is pretty bad .
p5842
aVThe Olys and Panys are better all around than the Sonys , in my experience .
p5843
aVBut none of them can touch the V1 for speed and accuracy .
p5844
aVI have gone through a number of these cameras trying to find something that can augment my DSLR .
p5845
aVI was almost to the point of trying a small Nikon DSLR , and some reviews on the Nikon 1 were n't encouraging .
p5846
aVI have never been disappointed with a Nikon camera , so I decided to make the V1 my last gasp effort at a small camera .
p5847
aVI can not tell you how thrilled I am with this camera .
p5848
aVIf you like to shoot things like birds in flight the V1 can do it better than any entry level DSLR and better than many upper level DSLRs .
p5849
aVFocus speed and accuracy are incredible .
p5850
aVIf you have a subject moving directly toward you at good speed , you might get `` runned over '' but the V1 will get you a sharp picture of your demise .
p5851
aVThis little thing will lock on to a target like a bull dog if you use the right settings .
p5852
aVAnd there is the rub .
p5853
aVThe people who will like this camera more quickly are enthusiasts who understand the basics .
p5854
aVBut do n't let that frighten you .
p5855
aVIf you can learn to drive a car you can learn the basics of photography .
p5856
aVAnd if you have children the exercise will be worthwhile .
p5857
aVDo you want sharp photos of your child running toward you ?
p5858
aVAnd do you want 10 sharp photos of that in one second ?
p5859
aVThis is the only small camera that can do that , PERIOD .
p5860
aVThe camera does have some irritating characteristics .
p5861
aVAll cameras do .
p5862
aVYou wo n't like the selector dial because it easily gets bumped out of place .
p5863
aVYou wo n't like the mandatory auto review of photos , except when you are shooting continuous frames .
p5864
aVThere are other things you might not like .
p5865
aVBut the overall performance of the camera makes adapting to the camera easy and fun .
p5866
aVUntil a V2 comes along this is absolutely the best small camera you can get .
p5867
aa(lp5868
VPaid even more for this at Target I think almost $ 60 .
p5869
aVMic does n't even work , video is like 1\u005c/5 the quality I get on my iPhone , of course -- there 's no audio , so you ca n't even compare .
p5870
aVToo bad , it was a Christmas present for my daughter and it 's going back tomorrow .
p5871
aVTarget\u005c/Amazon should n't even sell junk like this .
p5872
aa(lp5873
VFinally found a replacement cable for my camera .
p5874
aVThe problem with this cable was the end that connects to the camera is too bulky to originally fit properly so I had take a knife and widdle down the top corner of the surrounding rubber to make it fit .
p5875
aVStill the price makes it worth 4 stars , and it works which is all I care about .
p5876
aa(lp5877
VI was truly blown away by the picture quality !
p5878
aVI just printed some of the pictures and they look way better than I anticipated from a waterproof camera - insanely inexpensive at that .
p5879
aVI kept the camera submerged for long periods of time and I never noticed any sort of leakage .
p5880
aVMy vacation would not have been complete without it ... serious !
p5881
aVOnly drawback is the speed at which you can take multiple pictures in repetition .
p5882
aVThe screen takes a second to process the photo so you have to wait a few seconds to take another picture .
p5883
aa(lp5884
VI bought this in July 2010 .
p5885
aVIt was great when it worked !
p5886
aVA few months later , it stopped working .
p5887
aVIt was not damaged in any way , but it no longer turns on .
p5888
aVIn addition , the battery door does not open normally .
p5889
aVThis is actually the second Nikon I owned .
p5890
aVI had bought a L18 that stopped working too .
p5891
aVI will stop buying these affordable cameras .
p5892
aVI would rather invest more money in something that wo n't break .
p5893
aVWill be selling it for parts ...
p5894
aa(lp5895
VGot it a couple weeks ago , have used it a few times .
p5896
aVFirst real outing with it , recorded about 75 minutes of video , never ran out of battery .
p5897
aVSD card capability is just about worthless .
p5898
aVPictures are low resolution , videos are low resolution .
p5899
aVVideos are so low they do n't even look all that good when posted to Youtube -LRB- I 've already put videos of the kids up there -RRB- .
p5900
aVI have a Canon S3 that takes much better quality SD videos -LRB- though I 'm limited to 3 to 4 ~ 8 minute videos with the S3 on my 4GB card -RRB- .
p5901
aVFWIW , the 4GB card worked fine in the Elura .
p5902
aVThe poor digital resolution makes it lose a star in the rating .
p5903
aVTransferring to PC was effortless , though Canon did n't bother to include anything to help you transfer MiniDV recordings via firewire .
p5904
aVThat software is included with XP , or can be found with an inexpensive firewire card -LRB- I found a firewire card , cable , and video software bundle for under ten dollars -RRB- .
p5905
aVBut I love the ability to grab the camera and go - and throw it in my pocket if necessary -LRB- admittedly , I wear loose clothes -RRB- .
p5906
aVIt is very small ... smallest camcorder I 've ever owned .
p5907
aVI do n't find the controls hard to manage at all .
p5908
aVIt 's going to be a lot of fun to own , I can tell .
p5909
aVI 've had it for just under 2 weeks and I 've already made my first DVDs .
p5910
aa(lp5911
VThe DV camcorder market finally hit my price point at ~ $ $ $ -LRB- After rebate -RRB- in this product ... Does it have all the bells and whistles ?
p5912
aVNo. .
p5913
aVDoes it perform as advertised ?
p5914
aVPretty much -- if you take the time to read the manual and consider its ' limitations .
p5915
aVIt does best in favorable lighting , but does have features that compensate for sub-optimal lighting conditions -LRB- generally found indoors -RRB- .
p5916
aVNo night\u005c/low light mode , and the better the lighting , the better the colors .
p5917
aVThe lack of a viewfinder -LRB- unit has LCD panel only -RRB- has yet to be a hindrance -- although I have n't tried it outside in full sun\u005c/glare yet either .
p5918
aVThe resolution is good ; the case design and user interface is different than all other camcorders I 've owned , but easy to adapt to ; the IEEE 1394 connection works flawlessly in Win XP -LRB- with appropriate video editing software -- not included , firewire cable -- not included -RRB- in both directions .
p5919
aVIt has the standard special video effects -LRB- sepia , B , etc -RRB- , a still feature that records a frame onto the DV tape as long as the button is active -LRB- no semiconductor removable memory -- remember this is an entry level unit -RRB- .
p5920
aVSpare high capacity batteries can be found online for -LRB- $ $ delivered .
p5921
aVBottom line , used correctly this is a very good value at around $ $ $ -LRB- after incentive pricing -RRB- ...
p5922
aa(lp5923
VI bought this for myself as I wanted something with good quality audio and video .
p5924
aVThe playtouch has thus far proven to be worth every dollar plus some .
p5925
aVI have not used it in a night club settings as yet but the picture quality is great and the audio play back is very clean .
p5926
aVThe still pictures once there is light are very clean for a 5MP .
p5927
aVI am indeed happy with the product !
p5928
aa(lp5929
VI bought this when it first came out .
p5930
aVI had only used it a few times in 3 years before the record and picture taking screen went completely black .
p5931
aVIn researching possible malfunctions , there were numerious with this model , but no recall .
p5932
aVI wasted over $ 1,000.00 on this crap .
p5933
aVPLUS , the photos are terrible , as is the recording and battery life .
p5934
aVSuch a shame because I really like the general concept of this thing .
p5935
aVI just refuse now to buy anything Samsung or any sister company makes .
p5936
aVI do not have $ 1,000.00 to throw away , and that 's what I feel I 've done after I made this purchase .
p5937
aa(lp5938
VHaving used a sony camcorder for several years , with the switch to HD TV 's I was less satisfied with the playback I was getting .
p5939
aVWanting to record my childrn playing football I switched to the Canon Vixia and having recorded five games I am delighted with the results .
p5940
aVThe colors are sharp and vibrant and the definition of the feedback is excellent when played back on my 58 '' TV .
p5941
aVI use a Mac and imovie to edit the film from the camera .
p5942
aVTransfer speed is quick and editing the movies this way is easy .
p5943
aVThe camera has an automatic mode and so far this is the only mode I have used for recording scenes .
p5944
aVAs I said I am sitting in the stands at Junior High football games and the zoom is enough to see the action up close on the far side of the field .
p5945
aVThe touch screen is easy to use , in fact all the controls are easy to use and overall I am delighted with this purchase .
p5946
aVIn trying to think of a few negative points , to try to balance my review I will tell you that so far I can not find anything that has caused me even the slightest irritation .
p5947
aVI guess the only think is the battery that comes with the camera gives me about 40-50 minutes of real recording time , when I am switching it on and off to record the games .
p5948
aVI wish they still did an integral view finder , for sunny days and to extend the battery life , but so far this is not a major problem and I am going to invest in a spare battery , so that should solve my problems ... great camera and I am glad that I purchased it
p5949
aa(lp5950
VThis is an oustanding camera and an outstanding kit .
p5951
aVDo n't let the lack of 1080p video stop you .
p5952
aVThe 720p looks great and the MF is a plus when shooting video .
p5953
aVThe tones look great .

VI came from the EOS 40D which is a GREAT camera , but I have to say the 5D is amazing .
p5956
aVEven at ISO 1000 or long exposures there is very little if any noise in my photos .
p5957
aVI did n't realize how nice having a full-frame sensor would be , and am loving the true wide-angles I can get now .
p5958
aVMy 50MM lens has gone from a novelty to a true walkabout lens .
p5959
aVI 've since sold the two ef-s lenses I had and my 40D .
p5960
aVYou ca n't beat the price now either since the MK II is coming out .
p5961
aVGot it for half the original price !
p5962
aVUpdate 8\u005c/31\u005c/09 : This camera continues to operate flawlessly and gives spectacular results .
p5963
aVIn the time I 've had my 5D I have actually been selling prints -LRB- up to 24x36 with excellent quality -RRB- and have had people request I take their family portraits once they see the image quality .

aVThis is quite a boost for me since I am only a serious amateur .
p5965
aVI can see why this camera is such a favorite .
p5966
aVThere are a couple things about the EOS 5D Mark II that I would like to have : sensor cleaning facilities , weather sealing , and true VGA quality LCD on the back of the camera , but for the price of the upgrade , these things seem minor so I 'll be sticking with the 5D awhile longer .
p5967
aVCleaning the sensor has become no big deal after doing it a few times .
p5968
aVUPDATE 2\u005c/24\u005c/10 - I finally upgraded to the href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G5ZTLS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/184-3874410-8157968"> Canon EOS 5D Mark II 21.1 MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera -LRB- Body Only -RRB-  but would n't give up the original 5D for the world !
p5969
aVThe original 5D is my # 2 choice now and will be my backup camera to the Mark II .
p5970
aVIts images are just too perfect to replace , and it can still hold its own against the Mark II to anyone but the most discerning pixel-peepers .
p5971

VI note two reviewers said they heard motor noise on recordings and the other 16 reviewers did n't , with a few specifically noting they did not .
p5973
aVI have to say I have had this camcorder for two months , recorded about eight hours of video with a varietyof level of sound frm school plays , to ball games , to kids parties to quiete time , played and\u005c/or edited all that video , across a wide range of equipment from my computer to a ratehr high end hometheater and heard not one bit of background motor noise .
p5974
aVOverall this camera is a very good value .
p5975
aVi got mine for three fourty after rebate and saw it for three last month .
p5976
aVare some really whining the memory card is only 8mb or that it doesnt come with a case ?
p5977
aVare you kidding ?
p5978
aVa case is about fifteen bucks and cameras in this range and higher typically come with NO memory card or case !
p5979
aa(lp5980
VI absolutely love this camera .
p5981
aVI had a G11 before this and I 'm really happy with both the image and video camera .
p5982
aVA great camera if you 're not ready to take the plunge into a 5 or 7D
p5983
aa(lp5984
VI only gave it a one star , because I was told it was available , but now they say two weeks .
p5985
aVI always thought if something was available it was on hand .
p5986
aVWell back to the store if I want it for Christmas .
p5987
aa(lp5988
VIt 's a good day when you can spend around $ 750 and get a camera with the same sensor and similar feature set to the $ 1500 7D .
p5989
aVThank you , Canon .
p5990
aVI think the T2i will do fine as a beginner 's DSLR -- just turn the dial to `` full auto '' and you will get a very acceptable and usually excellent picture every single time .
p5991
aVBut the feature set is extensive so it 's a great camera for beginners who want to grow .
p5992
aVThe only real big difference between the T2i and what the pros use is it 's not a full frame camera -- but you wo n't touch full frame for less than $ 2500 for Canon or Nikon .
p5993
aVT2i low light performance , for anybody who has n't bought a DSLR in a couple of years , is astounding .
p5994
aVPretty much full detail at 3200 ?
p5995
aVCrazy .
p5996
aVI can take this camera out into the woods at night and get images of things that I ca n't even see with my eyes .
p5997
aVIf you graze the Amazon reviews you can find numerous anecdotal complaints about fuzzy images but I think it 's people who are messing with manual settings and not knowing what they 're doing .
p5998
aVIf you increase aperture you can lose sharpness .
p5999
aVIf you shoot in low light and the autofocus is struggling , you can lose sharpness .
p6000
aVUse a tripod !
p6001
aVUse faster shutter speed and smaller aperture !
p6002
aVTake advantage of the camera being able to shoot at 1600-3200 with very little noise .
p6003
aVOr if you ca n't or do n't want to figure it out , do n't be ashamed to turn the dial to green and let the camera do the work -- it will usually make very good decisions .
p6004
aVReports that 18 megapixels can mean less resolution than , say , 10 or 12 megapixel DSLRs are also not true and have been debunked .
p6005
aVThe reason people think that is that 18 megapixels produces such a large image that when you zoom in , you are more likely to see an imperfect focus or camera shake or an incorrect aperture .
p6006
aVSince an 18 MP image is so much larger you can zoom in further .
p6007
aVSometimes you 're hitting the limit of what your lens can resolve -- if you need sharpeness for gigantic prints , you may have to invest in expensive lenses -LRB- though first , PLEASE , meet Mr. Tripod -- you 'll be amazed at the difference it can make in sharpness . -RRB-
p6008
aVIf you want to compare T2i performance to other dslrs in a side by side comparison , I recommend the imaging resource comparometer : -LRB- ... -RRB- ... The T2i 's images are terrifically detailed .
p6009
aVAnyway , there are so many great camera choices out there .
p6010
aVProbably this one is for people who want to do serious amateur photography and really need the camera 's capabilities to shoot landscapes , sports , indoors , wildlife etc. .
p6011
aVFor just general family pictures indoor and outdoor the T2i is overkill -- there are great entry level DSLRs or Micro-four-thirds cameras that will produce fantastic images up to 13 by 19 -- which is as big as most people would ever print .
p6012
aVI 'd actually look at the entry level Olympus DSLRs -LRB- small and wonderful -RRB- and the Micro 4-3 Panasonic G-series and Olympus E-P series .
p6013
aa(lp6014
VSo far this camera has went above and beyond my expectations .
p6015
aVIt takes amazing pictures in and out of the water .
p6016
aVI have used this camera mainly for floating trips on the river and it 's great not having to worry about it getting wet .
p6017
aVIt 's very east to use and I could n't be happier with the camera , especially for the price .
p6018
aa(lp6019
VI 'm very pleased with the camera .
p6020
aVPhotos are clear and the basic functions are easy to use .
p6021
aVPrimary information is in a small written manual ; more detailed instructions must be consulted via an online manual .
p6022
aVThis camera has a great deal of versatility for its size .
p6023
aVLearning all the features is time consuming and I 'm sure I will enjoy the camera even more once I have more experience with it .
p6024
aVBattery life is excellent and the camera takes many photos on one charge .
p6025
aVI received the camera right away and the shipping service was excellent .

p6043
aa(lp6044
VI am very impressed with this product .
p6045
aVFor a mere $ 100 , I was able to get 3.2 megapixel pictures with great color .
p6046
aVThe camera options were easy to figure out and use .
p6047
aVOne thing I want to add , on top of all the already superb reviews here , is that its compatibility with the Linux operating system is great .
p6048
aVI run Fedora Core 3 on my home computer , and all I had to do was plug the USB cable into my computer and it recognized the camera , the pictures , and gave me all the options I needed to downloads the pics .
p6049
aVI did n't have to install any software all !
p6050
aVIt all happened automatically .
p6051
aVI am very impressed .
p6052
aVI have no complaints at all .
p6053
aa(lp6054
VPurchased this mainly for my son .
p6055
aVTill date i have tried out the terrestrial viewing the moon viewing and results are spectacular .
p6056
aVIn this the image is viewed upright -LRB- for terrestrial viewing -RRB- because this is a refraction telescope ; unlike reflection telescope which i had earlier -LRB- edu science-Astro-Nova 100 Telescope -RRB- However for serious far off objects one does need to buy additonal lenses -LRB- barlow lens particularly -RRB- I stll havent bought that yet but certainly plan to do so .
p6057
aVThe telescope has built in star pointer -LRB- kind of a small red dot which illuminates the viewing scope center , at the press of a button and can be switched off likewise .
p6058
aVFor the price i 'd say this telescope is solid and doesnt disapoint -LRB- ideal for planet viewing for kids and adults alike -RRB-
p6059
aa(lp6060
VFuji F505 is a nice and compact camera packed with tons of features .
p6061
aVIts 15x optical zoom is great .
p6062
aVThe only set back is the video features .
p6063
aVEven though it offers high resolution video recording but it can only playback with quicktime software .
p6064
aVI tried to playback the video files with nero and window media player and it was totally distorted and useless for creating , editing home videos .
p6065
aVIn addition , the video quality is so poor when recording indoor .
p6066
aVAlthough the price is competitive , I would not recommend this camera .
p6067
aa(lp6068
VFirst of all I want to plainly say that this a great DV-Cam for a low $ 499 !!!
p6069
aVDo n't tell me that 's not a low price for such quality .
p6070
aVI have one and use it to make skate-videos .
p6071
aVI do a lot of skateboarding -LRB- 3-4hrs \u005c/ day -RRB- and this thing has it all !
p6072
aVIt is light weight , small , high quality , durable , and full of all the effects and features you could ever need .
p6073
aVDo n't pass thing up , trust me !
p6074
aa(lp6075
VThis camera takes beautiful pictures , and the pop-up flash works fantastic even in total darkness .
p6076
aVPictures are crisp and clear , and the manual settings are great for advanced photographers .
p6077
aVThe editing software in the camera is helpful too so you can crop , rotate or resize your photos before uploading them , as well as saving them to their own albums for later .
p6078
aVI would very highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants to take thousands of casual everyday pictures , or step it up a notch and take professional grade photos .
p6079
aa(lp6080
VPurchased this for my daughter to use on a study abroad program and thereafter .
p6081
aVThe picture quality was great , she felt it was straightforward to use , although battery life did n't seem fantastic .
p6082
aVBut the deal killer is that 10 months later , with no warning or obvious reason , it is bricked with the apparently-famous `` lens error - restart camera '' problem .
p6083
aVTried various simple fixes as noted on forums to no avail .
p6084
aVSo now it 's just an expensive doorstop .
p6085
aVI have had better luck with my Fuji digital camera , which is simple and reliable for several years .
p6086
aa(lp6087
VIt sounds good on paper , but the responsiveness and image quality is just not that good .
p6088
aVI played with high ISO shots , and then I played with Lumix TS3 , and the Sony TX10 ; I think it 's embarassing when generic electronic companies do better than the photo-dedicated giant like Nikon -LRB- and all the backlit-cmos mumbo-jumbo is not helping out -RRB- .
p6089
aVAside from better high-iso shots from sony and panny , the lens actually opens up a little more on sony and panasonic -LRB- f\u005c/3 .5 , and f\u005c/3 .3 , respectively -RRB- , whereas on the Nikon it 's f\u005c/3 .9 -LRB- even this little bit makes quite a bit of difference in the dark -RRB- .
p6090
aVAnd both Sony and Panasonic feel more responsive , when focusing and taking a picture ... There are many cons and pros to all these cameras , but the Nikon consistently looses out on the actual ability to take pictures .
p6091
aVIt 's an OK camera with GREAT specs ; but , after playing with the competition , I do n't consider the Nikon 's bringing to the table a worthwhile competitor .
p6092
aVInterestingly , Canon is also not participating in this waterproof camera game -LRB- effectively -RRB- .
p6093
aVI ended up going with Sony for its smaller size , even though I 'm not a fan of the touchscreen .
p6094
aVPanasonic is also a VERY GOOD alternative .
p6095
aa(lp6096
VSince writing my first raving review on this camera it has fallen to the `` Blue Screen of Death '' that most JVC cameras face .
p6097
aVNo recording , no playback .
p6098
aVThe screen just states that I need to clean the heads .
p6099
aVAfter 10 brand new head cleaners have been tried and fail the view screen still remains blue .
p6100
aVI was trying to use the digital camera mode but even that hardly if ever works .
p6101
aVI now have a shiny item to hold balloons down or better yet to use when I want people to THINK they are being videotaped .
p6102
aVGone is my previous high rating , this camera is just plain junk .
p6103
aa(lp6104
VAs with any digital camera on the market , there is no `` perfect '' price\u005c/perfomance ratio .
p6105
aVThe DRebel however at the time it was released was arguably a excellent camera for the cost !
p6106
aVThe pictures -LRB- if taken correctly -RRB- can be amazing .
p6107
aVAnd the manual control of the camera gives you a lot of artistic freedom I have yet to see in other cameras .
p6108
aVEven though all my friends are dissapointed that one can not look at the LCD there 's assurance in the viewfinder because what you see is really what you get .
p6109
aVOh , and that wide angle lens ... wow !
p6110
aVYou have no clue what a difference that makes in a small room !
p6111
aVThis camera is a great value !
p6112
aVThe only problem I had is that after 18,000 shots in 90 days the auto-focus went out , something that could be easily repaired by Canon but since the store I bought it from has a 90-day return policy I opted to return the camera and buy a Canon 10D .

VI got this as a Christmas present a while back .
p6131
aVI like being able to record my riding videos , and this makes it dead simple .
p6132
aVI do n't particularly care for the software you have to use , but it is functional , and does n't get in the way .
p6133
aVOperation is dead simple .
p6134
aVThere 's a `` diagnostic '' button that will help you line up the lens as well as display the battery\u005c/SD card status , and there 's the `` record '' slider .
p6135
aVIt 's a giant button that takes up 75 % of the top of the device , and is easily operated with thick gloves .
p6136
aVThe mounts that this camera comes with are straight forward , and I 've yet to have a problem with them not adhering to my helmets .
p6137
aVVideo quality is what I would expect from a 720p camera .
p6138
aVAs far as sound goes ... well , I usually just throw out the sound from my videos , but I 've yet to see a helmet camera that produces useful sound at highway speeds , so I 'm not knocking this one for it either .
p6139
aVFor the money , there is n't a simpler camera on the market .
p6140
aVIf you 're going to be on a trip for multiple days , just make sure to bring a laptop , as you 'll have no other way of cleaning up your memory card to make room for more videos .
p6141

VLove the feel and weight of this camera - feels like a real camera but not too big or too small .
p6143
aVGood grip while focusing .

p6145
aVImages are crisp with good color accuracy .

aVThe LCD is excellent and the tilt screen a plus , esp .
p6147
aVto close the LCD for protection while carrying camera .

p6157
aVI do n't want to have to install their stupid software , what if I 'm not at home and want to load my pics on another machine .
p6158
aVI guess I have to carry around an sd card reader .
p6159
aVAlso , 1.45 volt alkaline batteries would n't even turn this puppy on .
p6160
aVI had to use brand new 1.55 volt batteries .
p6161
aVI 'm thinking of returning this if I can since , naturally none of my 1.25-1 .35 volt nimh rechargeables would work either .
p6162
aVJust to be sure , I put the 1.45 batteries into a standard 2 D cell flashlight -LRB- by using AA to D adapter shells -RRB- and it 's as bright as anything brand new .
p6163
aVAnd if you know flashlights you know the brightness is a very good measure of how much voltage the batteries can put out when in a circuit - even better than using a meter , unless you put a load on or use a special battery circuit with a load .
p6164
aVSo , if batteries this good wo n't even budge this camera , then forgetaboutit !
p6165
aVAfter trying many batteries , it is possible that this is just my camera , but other 's seem to have had the same problems .
p6166
aVSo , I ca n't say if this is an un-feature of this camera , or if mine is just overly sensitive to the input voltage .
p6167
aVOh , one more issue .
p6168
aVThey keep mentioning an a\u005c/v out , but there really is n't one .
p6169
aVThey imply you can hook directly to a tv , but you ca n't .
p6170
aVAll there is is a usb port , so you 'd still have to install their software , and use that to transfer the files -LRB- instead of simply drag\u005c/drop -RRB- and then if you have a tv that can hook up to a computer , then you could show the pictures or videos on the tv .
p6171
aVThey act like you can just hook up a pair of a\u005c/v cables to the camera and the tv .
p6172
aVI 'd have to say someone screwed da pooch here .
p6173
aVI do n't think they are referring to the docking station connector either , as that is not where they point and say a\u005c/v out in the manual .
p6174
aVThe manual also says that it outputs either ntsc or pal .
p6175
aVEither way , I ca n't find out how and they do n't show any pictures of any a\u005c/v outputs .
p6176
aVI bought this here for a low price of under $ 60 and even then I would n't buy it had I known better .
p6177
aa(lp6178
VWe lost our camera in the water off the Na Pali Coast in Kauai .
p6179
aVA week later , the boat captain was snorkeling in the same general area with another group and found it !
p6180
aVShe turned it on and it was still working and the pictures were still there .
p6181
aVCa n't wait to get it back !
p6182
aa(lp6183
VVery pleased with the camera !
p6184
aVGreat low light pics .
p6185
aVWanted very high end pocketable camera with manual controls .
p6186
aVFound very favorable professional reviews for both the Canon S95 and the Panasonic LX5 .
p6187
aVNoted that while the LX5 had a wider lens -LRB- 24mm -RRB- , a larger battery , and more control over video shoting , it was larger than the Cannon S95 and did n't review well for auto mode operation .
p6188
aVOnly recommendation for potential buyers : get a spare battery and seriously consider a fast SD card -LRB- e.g. Class 10 -RRB- .
p6189
aVCamera can process pics and video very quickly but can be hindered by a slow card .
p6190
aa(lp6191
VUpdate -LRB- June 9,2011 -RRB- The first Zx3 I bought -LRB- for which I wrote the original review -RRB- was lost at sea during a video session .
p6192
aVI bought a second Zx3 about six weeks ago and three days past the Amazon return date expiration , it stopped working .
p6193
aVSpecifically the camera powers up and the screen goes black immediately .
p6194
aVPower is on , ca n't see the image .
p6195
aVI contacted Kodak support which I knew would be unfruitful but I wanted to cover my bases just in case it was something simple .
p6196
aVThey sent me an email stating what I needed to do , which was send it into a contracted repair center .
p6197
aVFrom receipt of the product they said it takes about two weeks to either have the camera repaired or to send a refurbished unit .
p6198
aVEither is fine with me , but I do n't hold much faith in this camera being something that will last long term , that is , over a year .
p6199
aVI would however like it to be reliable for at least a year .
p6200
aVI hope that happens .
p6201
aVYou get what you pay for if you 're lucky .
p6202
aVThis is an inexpensive camera that does a lot for the price .
p6203
aVThey have to cut corners somewhere and I think that the overall build quality is not very good .
p6204
aVThis will be my fourth Playsport .
p6205
aVI 've owned two Zx5 's and they were both disasters , definitely a `` do not buy '' item .
p6206
aV-LRB- I wrote a review on the Zx5 . -RRB-
p6207
aVThis being said , my speculation is that all waterproof cams in this price range are probably about the same as the Zx3 .
p6208
aV--------------------------------- -LRB- Original review . -RRB-
p6209
aVI bought this camera for a specific sports oriented purpose , to take videos and still images in the water of people surfing .
p6210
aVThe camera does a very good job of this with several caveats .
p6211
aV1 -RRB- It does not do well in low light like early mornings or late evenings 2 -RRB- Even though it can take 5mp still shots , it has no continuous frame shooting mode .
p6212
aVFor a camera that bills itself as a `` sports '' -LRB- as in PlaySPORT -RRB- camera , this is a significant failing , but one that can be overlooked in favor of the excellent quality videos it takes , as well as the camera 's low price point .
p6213
aVPROS - Relatively quick boot-up ; good quality video especially at 760p -LRB- 60fps -RRB- mode - Excellent anti-glare picture quality -LRB- important for shooting in the ocean where there can be significant glare from sunlight reflected off ocean waves and the sea surface -RRB- - Extremely easy to use ; selectable settings that significantly reduce glare on the viewing screen so you can see what you 're shooting - Light weight and easy to access -LRB- I tuck my PlaySport into my wetsuit and the rounded corners on the camcorder make it fairly easy to pull out and start shooting -RRB- - Adequate build durability -LRB- I 've already scratched the plastic case on the camera I 've owned and used for two weeks , but other than that it 's looking good and water tight -RRB- - Adequate -LRB- so far -RRB- lens protection -LRB- instead of a hatch or door that opens and closes over the lens like some waterproof pocket-cameras have , the PlaySport has a raised rim around the lens .
p6214
aVThis is much better than a moving part that can get clogged with sand or other debris and which often leaves a drop of water or water smear on the camera lens which distorts the final image . -RRB-
p6215
aV- Adequate image stabilization -LRB- I filmed a recent surf trip where the surfing areas were accessed by boat .
p6216
aVI shot a lot of footage while the boat was in motion .
p6217
aVIt was a fairly bumpy ride and I thought the video was pretty bouncy with the images being recognizable .
p6218
aV-LRB- It did n't make you want to barf when viewing though ! -RRB-
p6219
aVBut my friend who owns the boat thought the image quality was fantastic .
p6220
aVThe eye of the beholder I guess . -RRB-
p6221
aV- Feels good in the hand , point and shoot is a breeze , function buttons are easily accessible .
p6222
aVCONS - NOT an indoor camera .
p6223
aVNo flash .
p6224
aVLow light daytime\u005c/nighttime\u005c/indoor images are soft and fuzzy at best , color completely distorted .
p6225
aV- No continuous frame shooting for stills .
p6226
aV- Could have better image stabilization .
p6227
aV- Camera is plastic , it will scratch .
p6228
aVSoftware - The first time you plug your camera into your computer you can load ArcSoft Media Impression for Kodak .
p6229
aVThe PlaySport records .
p6230
aVMOV files by default .
p6231
aVUntil I took a few minutes to view the tutorial video -LRB- duh ! -RRB-
p6232
aVI hated the software .
p6233
aVOnce I got used to it -LRB- it did n't take long -RRB- I like it a lot .
p6234
aVIt is easy to use and makes simple , pleasant to view movies .
p6235
aVThe software also will convert the .
p6236
aVMOV files to .
p6237
aVAVI files so you can use Windows Movie Maker .
p6238
aVYou can use Apple video editing software too .
p6239
aVThe one caveat is that it takes quite a while to save your movie to your computer once you are finished making it .
p6240
aVAnd it uses a lot of your computer 's resources .
p6241
aVI have a fairly new computer and it 's still pretty slow .
p6242
aVIt also can interfere with other computer functions as simple as making it tedious to surf the internet .
p6243
aVSUMMARY For the price and video quality , the Kodak PlaySport is a great camcorder that does the job -LRB- noting the caveats I 've listed -RRB- .
p6244
aVI got mine for $ 108 .
p6245
aVFor that price forget an extended warranty , which are usually mandatory for a `` waterproof '' camera .
p6246
aV-LRB- The PlaySport comes with a one-year warranty . -RRB-
p6247
aVWho knows , next year some of my CONS may have been addressed by Kodak and I 'll be ready to buy the next generation PlaySport .
p6248
aa(lp6249
VI received this camera as a gift for use in a beginner 's photography course , and I could n't have been more prepared for the course .
p6250
aVI sailed thru the course with flying colors and have moved on to more advanced studies .
p6251
aVHowever , even though I am now shooting with an entry level DSLR -LRB- yes .
p6252
aV.
p6253
aValso a Canon .
p6254
aV.
p6255
aVI 'm officially Team Canon -RRB- , the powershot is always with me when I am working on course work , and the powershot is the first choice of mine for leisure snaps as well .
p6256
aVThe only con I have regarding this camera is that it is very sleek in feel , and there have been a few times where if I was n't using the wrist strap , the camera would have slipped away from me .
p6257
aa(lp6258
VHaving used the G3 as a workhorse supplement to my DSLRs I kept holding off on the newer G series cameras .
p6259
aVThe ability to shoot HD video and smaller size finally won me over .
p6260
aVThe camera is solid and easy to use .
p6261
aVI 'd like a couple of minor tweaks in terms of use , but the shutter response is fast and the exposures are well balanced .
p6262
aVIt is larger than most compact digital cameras , but the ones I 've used are challenged to make prints 20x30 or larger -LRB- focus and optical quality being the primary issue -RRB- .
p6263
aVThe G3 -LRB- at 4 MP -RRB- can take very good 16x20s , and 20x30s at lower ISO settings on the G12 are fantastic .
p6264
aVOne other note - the first camera shipped to me by Amazon was lost\u005c/stolen in the mail .
p6265
aVWhile I was stunned that they shipped a $ -LRB- ... -RRB- product without requiring a signature -LRB- the threshold is $ 700 -RRB- , they -LRB- Amazon -RRB- were fantastic .
p6266
aVThey immediately shipped a replacement camera and even expedited the shipping .
p6267
aa(lp6268
VI was looking to upgrade from a regular point and shoot without getting into a serious DSLR because of size and costs and was looking at the LX3 .
p6269
aVThen I saw the LX5 was going to be released soon , so I waited and placed an order on it .
p6270
aVThis small , but not tiny camera takes great pics especially in low light situations .
p6271
aVIt could use a little more zoom for outdoor vacation shots , but for almost every situation , this camera takes awesome pics and is small enough to carry everywhere .
p6272
aVOnly downside is the included software , but most LX5 owners like myself will use other 3rd party software to edit photos .
p6273
aa(lp6274
VWell it almost seems like everything is now like an iPad !
p6275
aVOperating this little device is definately one touch and not multi touch .
p6276
aVIT was fully charged when you switch on the device -LRB- that was a plus -RRB- .
p6277
aVThe packaging was beautiful and I thought I was getting a nice of piece of jewelry !
p6278
aVThis little camcorder\u005c/camera has a glass face that provides most of the functions with the exception of an one\u005c/off button , camera button and another button for start\u005c/stop video recording .
p6279
aVThere is an initial set up prompt menu when you first start the device and a demo video that gets you all excited that you immediately want to play with it !
p6280
aVPros of this device 1 -RRB- camera provides photo size of 12megap , 8m , or 2m 2 -RRB- movie size 1080 -LRB- 30p -RRB- , 720 -LRB- 60p -RRB- , 720 -LRB- 30p -RRB- 3 -RRB- camera self timer -LRB- 2 or 10 minutes -RRB- 4 -RRB- zoom touch 5 -RRB- camera has a single face recognition 6 -RRB- delete and view of saved items very easy to navigate 7 -RRB- mini hdmi to allow view to television 8 -RRB- auto focus , not fastest response , but if panning slowly , it works great 9 -RRB- a USB that is neatly stored in body of camera 10 -RRB- allows for a mini tripod to be attached 11 -RRB- for each of the saved photo\u005c/movie youncan tag it to you tube , facebook , flickr , and prelabeled email addresses .
p6281
aV12 -RRB- the picture will rotate likemit is an iPhone\u005c/touch !
p6282
aV13 -RRB- volume adjust on playback is great and picks up voices very well .
p6283
aV14 -RRB- weighs less than iphone4 Con : you have to buy a separate pouch !
p6284
aVDoes get warm after using for half an hour continuously .
p6285
aVThis can only be used with windows and is not compatible to Mac !
p6286
aVHmm , not good .
p6287
aV-LRB- update as of February 2011 , software is now available to Mac users to allow download to a MAC !
p6288
aVYeah -RRB- Also , wish there were some rubber gribs around the edge as it can get a little slippery to hold , but you do get use to it and adjust your grip to accomodate it .
p6289
aVResults : even in low lighting , both the camera and camcorder recorded pretty good results .
p6290
aVThe auto zoom will adjust from a moderate panning speed to avoid blurs .
p6291
aVWe were quite impressed with how well the auto focus adjusted .
p6292
aVSetting up the software was easy and detected the device immediately .
p6293
aVThe picture is a little grainy whe using less than 12 megapixel , and the playback on the hd1080 -LRB- I , which is what we suspect -RRB- was actually not bad on our 46 inch tv !
p6294
aVIt is simple to use and I am usually the one that needs the manual and get over whelmed with the numerous functionalities .
p6295
aVIt was very intuitive and really simple to use for the market it is aimed at : shooting fun footages to share with family and friends .
p6296
aVUpdate : December 12th : in low light and indoor shoorting : the picture\u005c/video can come out with a tinge of yellow .
p6297
aVThis result will happen if you shoot too quickly without allowing the camera to ` accumulate ' a little more light .
p6298
aVThe results are great for outdoors and very sharp finish -LRB- then again this is more for outdoor than indoor !
p6299
aVWe are still loving how light it is and that with the touch screen you can move the focus and hold the Touch with one hand !
p6300
aa(lp6301
VI decided to upgrade my sony cybershot to this 110x optical zoom ... it is n't a noticeable upgrade , except you can zoom more , the quality of the pics is more or less the same as my last camera ... but it does take great shots , sometimes it takes some time for the snapshot to be taken as it 's a bit delayed and when I load my pics on my computer from my camera , somehow the videos do n't transfer , and I do n't know why and how to fix this problem which I did n't have with my last cam .
p6302
aVThe camera 's lid which you have to slide to get the battery has become a bit loose , i do n't know why , cos my camera is brand new and has never fallen , it 's pretty annoying , i hope it does n't get worse as i paid about almost 200 US for my camera ... apart from these drawbacks , it 's a good cam to buy ...
p6303
aa(lp6304
VI should have paid attention to the negative reviews .
p6305
aVThe picture quality was horrendous .
p6306
aVTook a picture of a dog sleeping on the couch-it was blurry .
p6307
aVPacked it up and sent it right back .
p6308
aVBought a different brand for a bit more money .
p6309
aVStay away from this one .
p6310
aa(lp6311
VThis camera exceeds my expectations every time I use it .
p6312
aVIt 's photo quality is top notch , it is small and portable - but also sturdy and well made , it has a pop up flash and all the features and adjustments you will ever need !
p6313
aVI have had this camera over and year now and it is still going strong , and taking amazing pictures !
p6314
aVI love the Canon PowerShot S90 !!!
p6315
aa(lp6316
VMy first digital camera was a Canon G2 -LRB- very slow but destined to become a classic -RRB- .
p6317
aVMy second camera was a Sony H1 .
p6318
aVWhat I soon missed with the Sony was the swivel screen of the G2 , and I did n't care for the ergonomics of the H1 , the autofocus\u005c/manual focus performance and the 12 seconds between flash shots either .
p6319
aVI recently bought the S3 because I really liked the overall look and feel : it felt like a combination of the G2 and a digital SLR in a small package .
p6320
aVThe video performance is impressive as is the image stabilization -LRB- which was not as good with the H1 -RRB- .
p6321
aVOverall , picture taking performance in various modes is quite good and preferred over the H1 , although both the H1 and S3 suffer from poor high ISO\u005c/low light performance .
p6322
aVThere remains , however , one serious S3 image problem : purple fringing .
p6323
aVOutdoor high zoom pictures where there is strong contrast between light and dark objects -LRB- skin in direct sunlight with strong shadow for instance -RRB- results in a thick violet outline or `` radioactive glow '' where light and dark meet .
p6324
aVCanon touts its lens technology of the S3 and states '' ... ultra low dispersion lens significantly reduces chromatic aberation in telephoto shots . ''
p6325
aVEven with this `` technology '' the S3 has almost twice the degree of chromatic aberation `` purple fringing '' as the Sony H1 -LRB- the G2 had some fringing but it was blue and less obvious - but only 3x telephoto -RRB- .
p6326
aVI 've done exhaustive comparisons between the two cameras to reach this conclusion .
p6327
aVStrangly , an old abused store demo S3 had less fringing than the new cameras - I returned two S3s because of this issue .
p6328
aVPerhaps the quality of lens manufacture declined with the newer units .
p6329
aVThe only partial remedy I found to this problem is to shoot all outdoor shots at f8 and do not exceed about 6x-8x instead of the max optical 12x telephoto .
p6330
aVThis will substantially reduce fringing in the center of photos , but not in the outer areas .
p6331
aVAlso , UV or polarizing filters do not help .
p6332
aVBecause I actually still like this camera so much , I 've decided to put up with the fringing handicap - until I finally give in to the expense and extreme bulk of a decent digital SLR and quality telephoto lens .
p6333
aa(lp6334
VThe A710 falls into a strange niche -- that is , it has no niche .
p6335
aVIt has a long zoom range , but not the screaming 12x reach of a superzoom .
p6336
aVIt has image stabilization but it lacks the larger , 10mp sensor of other new compacts .
p6337
aVIt 's smaller and cheaper than the G7 , but has fewer features , too .
p6338
aVIt has more features than an ultra-compact , but it 's not as pocketable .
p6339
aVThe A710 does everything great , but it does n't have a specific top feature to distinguish it from the rest of the pack .
p6340
aVBut it 's an excellent camera .
p6341
aV6x optical zoom is plenty unless you 're shooting a football game from the back row .
p6342
aVThe lens has little distortion or fringing -- issues I read about all the time with superzooms .
p6343
aVThe meter is fine , with hardly any highlight clipping if you leave exposure compensation at -2 \u005c/ 3 .
p6344
aVThat great vagary , `` image quality , '' is first rate as far as I 'm concerned .
p6345
aVThe A710 fits in a pant or jacket pocket .
p6346
aVIt gives you wide and easily accessed control over everything from saturation and tone to ISO and white balance .
p6347
aVThe full manual setting is a lifesaver when the program modes ca n't get the exact look you want .
p6348
aVThe menu system is logical , fast , and unobtrusive .
p6349
aVPhotos print great up to 8x10 '' , as you 'd expect from a 7mp camera .
p6350
aVBecause it 's so many pixels on such a small sensor , you 'll see some noise in the shadows and some details will be smeared by noise reduction even at the base ISO of 80 -- photograph a forest and you 'll see what I mean -- but that 's true of all compacts .
p6351
aVI would n't use ISO 800 unless printing smaller .
p6352
aVFortunately , image stabilization allows you to keep the ISO at 400 or lower even indoors .
p6353
aV4x6 '' prints from ISO 400 are n't noisy to my eyes , but it depends on the subject .
p6354
aVOn a computer screen , ISO 400 is really noisy , but that 's blown up to sizes you 'd never print at .
p6355
aVFlash recharge is slow , but that 's the trade-off for using only 2 AA batteries -LRB- I should note that battery life is bad , as with all 2 AA battery cameras -RRB- .
p6356
aVI think flash usually looks ugly indoors anyway , so unless you shoot backlit subjects all the time , this issue wo n't be crippling .
p6357
aVWithout flash , shot-to-shot time is good .
p6358
aVThe LCD screen is good , too .
p6359
aVI 've read many complaints about its uselessness in bright light , but I never had this problem .
p6360
aVIf you 're taking pictures in such blinding conditions they 'll be over-exposed and probably not that great anyway .
p6361
aVExtra features like color accent and widescreen mode are cute and work well .
p6362
aVThe video is very good , especially because it 's image stabilized -- on my computer monitor it looks better than 8mm video does on my TV , and for less money than a camcorder .
p6363
aVThe files are huge , though .
p6364
aVIn my opinion , if you want top performance on any feature from zoom to low-light shooting , you should save for a DSLR .
p6365
aVThey get smaller , less expensive , and more useful every year .
p6366
aVGetting a more expensive or bigger compact camera wo n't get you there , so you might as well keep your expectations realistic .
p6367
aVIt depends on what 's important to you .
p6368
aVIf you want huge zoom , get a superzoom ; if you want a camera you could do magic tricks with , get an ultracompact ; this camera will do everything else in a low-priced , small package .
p6369
aVEvery camera has compromises .
p6370
aVThis model fits right there in the middle of it all .
p6371
aVIt 's great at what it does .
p6372
aa(lp6373
VAs usual , excellent Celestron optics !
p6374
aVThe telescoping mechanics seem a little stiff , but I expect that will loosen up with use .
p6375
aVGreat for birding , sports , or casual astronomy .

VI was disappointed after waiting for the 3 gen flip , and the unit kept saying it was hot and kept shutting off , could not even set it up .
p6382
aVWasted my time and money .
p6383
aVI went with the Kodak ZI8
p6384
aa(lp6385
VI have had these binoculars for years .
p6386
aVThe quality of the optics is what you 'd expect from Nikon .
p6387
aVThe price is good .
p6388
aVWe also have Nikon 7x35 binoculars and are happy with those as well .
p6389
aVIf you can afford these , do n't bother getting the cheaper brands .
p6390
aa(lp6391
VLots of reviews regarding the Sony DSC-HX9V Point  Shoot Camera .
p6392
aVHere are a few additional comments that the perspective buyer of this product may want to quickly review , and perhaps may lend some credence in your purchase decision .
p6393
aVToday 's newest Smart Phones are approaching , or have even surpassed , the capabilities of what a lower-end P Camera does - or has done .
p6394
aVToday 's higher-end P Cameras are approaching what a lower-end DSLR Camera does , or has done !
p6395
aVHowever , even the most recent sophisticated Smart Phones do not have the true capabilities of a `` good '' P Camera , just as a good P Camera does not have the true capabilities of a DSLR or SLT Camera .
p6396
aVCertain limited overlapping capabilities of the most recent Smart Phones , vs. P Cameras , vs. DSLR\u005c/SLT Cameras have created conditions and trends which have the Camera Manufacturers in a real quandary regarding which direction to take , at what price , degree of technical capability , and most importantly - what does the Consumer really want ?

aVHence a big reason why Nikon and Sony have brought out Camera products that are only slightly larger in physical size than a traditional P , yet offer `` removable Lenses '' -LRB- ie : -RRB- Sony 's NEX 3,5,7 , hence further approaching , but NOT equal to , DSLR\u005c/SLT capability .
p6398
aVThese newer NEX type products also carry hefty pricing at this time .
p6399
aVEnter the Sony DSC-HX9V P -LRB- which started selling in the second quarter of 2011 -RRB- .
p6400
aVWith so-many P type products to chose from , this Sony offering was initially `` just another face in the crowd '' , and buyers had NO REAL reason to select this product .
p6401
aVAh , but by the latter part of 2011 , people started taking note that this particular product is a true kick-butt , slightly different Point  Shoot .
p6402
aVTherefore without listing all the TECHNO features that are already posted on many other Amazon reviews , this review is more of an editorial to potentially help the reader .
p6403
aVI will state however , that this product offers very high : Sensor Mega-Pixels -LRB- 16.2 MP -RRB- , Optical -LRB- 16x -RRB- Zooming , Multiple Focusing Modes , 10FPS Shot Burst speed , Excellent Color Rendering for both Stills and Movie , has hardened 3 '' Gorilla Glass LCD with its own high pixel count , High Dynamic Ranging -LRB- ability to take photos in low light without a Flash -RRB- , easy to use display for selection of Features , plus a built-in User 's Guide , a GPS that works well when selected , Sony 's Exmore Sensor -LRB- same used in some DSLR 's -RRB- , Sony 's `` G '' Series Lens , and a `` host '' of other offerings .
p6404
aVThat is a lot of stuff for a Point  Shoot Camera which are normally only found on DSLR Camera products .
p6405
aVThe only negatives I 've found are : With the LCD and GPS left on at length , it will however consume Battery Power quickly - carry an extra charged Battery with you , or leave the GPS setting off , or only use it sparingly .
p6406
aVThe `` User 's Manual '' is 30pgs .
p6407
aVlong and does n't say a whole lot .
p6408
aVThe on-line printed `` User 's Guide '' is some 220pgs .
p6409
aVlong , provides in-depth usage instruction , but is only in HTML Format vs. PDF , can be difficult to follow  print out .
p6410
aVThere are programs for HTML to PDF conversion , but Sony should simply offer PDF format .
p6411
aVMy own photography primarily consists of Landscapes and Wildlife in which I utilize several DSLR\u005c/SLT type products made by Sony , Canon , and Nikon .
p6412
aVI also utilize a number of higher-end Point  Shoot Cameras for carry-around for those days or times when I 'm otherwise not planning a day of photography .
p6413
aVI am not a professional , only an amatuer who has an in-depth interest in Cameras and Photography .
p6414
aVThe bottom line : This is a great Sony product if you want to have a P that approaches entry-level DSLR capabilities , great Color Rendering , or just leave everything in its Auto-i , or Auto + Modes .
p6415
aVHope this review and insight helps others in their selection process .

VIn wanting to replace my old -LRB- JVC GRDVM90U -RRB- camera\u005c/camcorder combo , I looked at the Canon Optura 600 and the Sony DCR-PC1000 .
p6418
aVConsumer Reports claimed high return\u005c/defect rates for JVC models , so I steered clear away from purchasing another JVC -- especially since my old camcorder exhibited many of the same issues multiple people have documented in the GRDVM90U 's reviews .
p6419
aVBesides wanting to stick with MiniDV -LRB- for my old tapes ' sake -RRB- , what was most important to me in a replacement camcorder was 1 -RRB- size , 2 -RRB- still picture quality , 3 -RRB- low-light ability , and 4 -RRB- overall versatility .
p6420
aVThe Optura 600 delivered impeccably on all fronts .
p6421
aVSize-wise , it is the smallest MiniDV camcorder I 've seen on the market yet , although the Sony DCR-PC1000 appears to be a close second .
p6422
aVWhat I liked about the Optura more than the Sony , however , was the overall design -- it felt more solid and compact as opposed to small , but long and narrow .
p6423
aVI wanted to be able to tote something around fairly easily and unnoticably , and the Optura delivered .
p6424
aVIt was so small it fit easily in a small purse -LRB- along with other small gadgets , ie .
p6425
aVphone and Ipod -RRB- , and large pockets also made for a comfortable home for it .
p6426
aVThe still picture quality was probably the clincher in my final decision to go with the Optura over the Sony .
p6427
aVOne thing to note , however , is that the Optura 600 is 4.0 MP , \u005c* not \u005c* 4.3 MP .
p6428
aVRegardless , its 4.0 MP beats Sony 's 2.7 MP hands-down .
p6429
aVBecause it was important for me to purchase a camcorder that would also serve the purpose of a digital camera -LRB- why have one of each when you can have something that can do both well ? -RRB-
p6430
aV, I went for the higher-end Optura .
p6431
aVAlso , Canon 's Elph Series digital cameras have always appeared to deliver consistent , great-quality digital images -LRB- practically everyone I know owns some version of the Elph -RRB- , and I felt more comfortable knowing that Canon 's still-camera expertise would translate better to a camcorder combo than Sony 's -LRB- last I heard Canon did n't manufacture TVs , amplifiers , and PCs , as well -RRB- .
p6432
aVIn addition to having a more than adequate low-light function -LRB- sometimes , surprisingly , it makes dark shots brighter than desired -RRB- , it has all the basic functions and features one would expect from a camera of this caliber -LRB- ie .
p6433
aVspecial effects , video\u005c/picture transfer software , numerous manual and automatic settings , widescreen functionality , all the cables and connectors needed to hook up to your TV and PC , 10x optical zoom , etc. -RRB- .
p6434
aVThe one and only thing that I did like better in the Sony was its built-in , retractable lens cover -- I found myself constantly fiddling with the plastic lens cover of the Optura whenever I unexpectedly came across a shot I just \u005c* had \u005c* to have .
p6435
aVOther than that , I 'm quite thrilled with my purchase and have not been disappointed yet .
p6436
aVDesign-wise , yes , it is a bit awkward -LRB- depends on the size of your hand and the dexterity of your fingers , really -RRB- -- but this thing is tiny , so there has to be some compromise in ergonomics .
p6437
aVI 've found this to be a minor point , as the Optura 's style , design , and overall look more than compromise for the slight awkwardness that really only takes a little getting used to .
p6438
aVI often get many comments from strangers in awe of it whenever I take it out to capture a moment , and that alone is almost enough to overlook its minor faults .
p6439
aa(lp6440
VIf you want a camera to use for 2 years , then this is the one for you .
p6441
aVThe motor on my camera died after 2 years .
p6442
aVIt will cost as much to replace it as to buy a new one .
p6443
aV I expect better quality than that from Olympus .\u000aNN CD VBP JJR NN IN DT IN NNP .\u000a i expect better quality than that from Olympus .\u000a\u000a\u000aI am very disappointed .\u000aPRP VBP RB JJ .\u000aI be very disappointed .\u000a\u000a

VI wanted a pocket camcorder to fit in my purse and be ready to use at a moment 's notice .
p6447
aVBut , my initial use was to find out which of my two cats was urinating in the living room and where they were going .
p6448
aVI ordered the Flip HD and was bitterly disappointed in the lack of any controls and to have to sit through two hours of video and 2X speed was horrible .
p6449
aVAfter checking the gadget review websites , I decided to return the Flip and try the Kodak Zi8 .
p6450
aVI was very pleasantly surprised at how flexible the contols are and the high quality of the video output .
p6451
aVAt 16X fast forward it was a breeze to go through 4 hours of video and the included software makes it simple to upload videos to Facebook or YouTube .
p6452
aVI am very glad I made the change .
p6453
aVWhat people need to keep in mind is that this is NOT a professional camcorder to take wedding movies ; it IS a great little camera for catching those spur-of-the-moment videos that we all wish we had a camera on us to catch .
p6454
aa(lp6455
VWell , what can I say about this camera ?
p6456
aVIt 's fantastic , I used it in Cancun and it was perfect under the water , It 's a nice camera .
p6457
aa(lp6458
VThe camera is fine but its USB slot to charge it failed on both my first and replacement unit .
p6459
aVI had to buy a separate charger as the USB wont do it .
p6460
aVFactor that additional purchase into your plans .
p6461
aa(lp6462
VI bought this camera for my son in June of 2010 , just about 13 months ago .
p6463
aVI own multiple Digital SLRs , but this was for he and his mother to use periodically .
p6464
aVThe camera was taken to a Boy Scouting trip , on a school trip to Philadelphia , and to a few elementary school events .
p6465
aVI 'm guessing the camera has taken 250-500 pictures in total .
p6466
aVThe zoom no longer works .
p6467
aVIt simply stopped .
p6468
aVThe cost to repair is greater than the cost of the camera .
p6469
aVNow the camera itself still works fine , we can take pictures , but the ability to use the 3.6 X zoom is gone .
p6470
aVI 've tried countless internet suggestions\u005c/fixes to no avail .
p6471
aVGoogle search `` Nikon Coolpix known issues '' - lens errors are super common and happen frequently .
p6472
aVThe # of `` out of the box '' lens issues is a bit scary .
p6473
aVAs far as pocket\u005c/purse digitals go , this is the worst we 've owned -LRB- this is our 4th -RRB- .
p6474
aVI had a lot of hope for it .
p6475
aVFrom a form factor perspective , it was perfect and looked great .
p6476
aVBut it does a terrible job re : image quality and we end up with an inordinate amount of blurred photos compared to our others .
p6477
aVAnyway , buyer beware .
p6478
aVI 'm on my 3rd SLR , 2nd digital -LRB- one an 18MP version -RRB- .
p6479
aVWhile I 'm no professional , I know enough about digital cameras to say this one is shoddy at best .
p6480
aa(lp6481
VI bought one about 2 months ago and have been using it a lot .
p6482
aVIt is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light .
p6483
aVI like the technology of shooting at night from WX1 .
p6484
aVPanorama is fun and cool .
p6485
aVI can take many wide angle pic with WX1 .
p6486
aVThe only two drawback I found so far is 1 .
p6487
aVBattery does not last as long as the old Sony I have -LRB- T-3 and T-30 -RRB- 2 .
p6488
aVThere is static noise when recording video .
p6489
aVThis is not the zooming sound .
p6490
aVIt is just there all the time .
p6491
aVIt is annoying if you do n't have a loud background noise to cover it .
p6492
aa(lp6493
VWe ordered this recorder just one week before our Honeymoon .
p6494
aVThe recorder arrived as promised and it worked great !
p6495
aVWe could not be happier !
p6496
aa(lp6497
VFirst of all , let me say that the bottom-loading thing is terrible .
p6498
aVIt has more downsides than ups !
p6499
aVI mean , the way they have you open the deck exposes the entire tape assembly !
p6500
aVSony has said this is done to make the camera smaller - with D8 , you ca n't get smaller .
p6501
aVAnyway , back to the camera .

aVIt 's older brother , the TRB840 , has many feautres that the 740 skimps on .

p6505

p6522
aVI could monitor my house from anywhere in the world .
p6523
aV-LRB- Hi Kitty !
p6524
aVI see you . -RRB-
p6525
aVOne day it stopped working .
p6526
aVI contacted the seller -LRB- SA Technology -RRB- They were very friendly and answered my e-mails promptly .
p6527
aVNot only did they replace the camera , Jeff from SA Technology personally dropped it off at my house !
p6528
aVTo add icing on the cake , the replacement camera was actually the newest model .
p6529
aVI give this new model 5 stars and SA Technology 5 stars for customer service .
p6530
aa(lp6531
VI bought this camera on an impulse .
p6532
aVI went home for a week and had two graduations and a wedding to go to .
p6533
aVAfter trying to take pictures at the first graduation I realized quickly I would need a new camera that night .
p6534
aVThe picture quality is excellent !
p6535
aVI love the steady shot and the shutter speed has been able to take great pictures of family and friends in motion .
p6536
aVI was originally hoping for a camera that took batteries , I can carry around AA 's easily and was worried that the battery would be a hassel .
p6537
aVThe battery life has worked wonderful -LRB- and believe me I used this camera a lot in the past week -RRB- .
p6538
aVIt also takes a relatively short amount of time to charge which is nice .
p6539
aVThe camera does take a few seconds to load a picture to view it , which can be very annoying when looking at more than a few pictures .
p6540
aVVideo quality is good and easy to use but the sound is quiet -LRB- not a big deal to me since my last camera did n't do sound -RRB- .
p6541
aVIt also makes a lot of sound while taking pictures which can be annoying if you are trying to be quiet -LRB- like when the bride walks down the asile -RRB- .
p6542
aVI also have a little difficulty opening up the AVI output and battery area .
p6543
aVOverall this camera did great .
p6544
aVIt 's slim enough that I could hide it in my dress at a wedding , the pictures were wonderful , and the battery life was great .
p6545
aVAfter three full days of use , turning it on and off repeatedly for several hours and taking pictures in various conditions -LRB- inside , outside , low light , bright light , movement , ect -RRB- I have over 500 good pictures and still have half the battery left .
p6546
aVAfter doing some research online and using this camera like I have I can safely say I would buy this camera again .
p6547

aVThe Camera is so light and compact , there are many camcorders that are light , I 've used a Sony , Cannon and now this is the second JVC that I use , its small enough to make it stable in your hand , some camcorders are small and light which make them shake in your hands , the design of this allows it to be very stable in your hand .

aVIt has a high resolution -LRB- 540 lines -RRB- which is really great , I 'm comparing it with other Sony Cameras that only have 500 or 510 and cost twice as much .
p6554
aV4 .
p6555
aVThe built in night light is Excellent , the colors I got after turning on the light -LRB- in low light conditions -RRB- are just amazing .
p6556
aV5 .
p6557
aVThe ability of the Camcorder to convert between Analog and Digital -LRB- line in recording -RRB- 6 .
p6558
aVThis might not be a big deal to some , but it is to me , the Camera is MADE IN JAPAN .
p6559
aVCONS What I did not like about the camera is just a very minor issue which is : The A\u005c/V connection is not the standard type that you would buy from any store , it has its own A\u005c/V connection cable I 've read that people are complaining about a sound issue , this is the second JVC I 've used , the sound is higher than what you 'd see in other Camcorders .
p6560
aVHowever I did not notice that until I read the reviews .
p6561
aVThe sound of the Camera is not a problem as far as I 'm concerned , maybe I 'm not picky Overall , this is an Excellent deal .
p6562
aVSome people go with Sony because of the name , but I like to compare specifications , this Camera equals most Sony camcorders in specifications , but the price is much less .
p6563
aVSony has a big name , but is it worth to pay double the amount to get a name ???
p6564
aVI recommend this camera , In fact , I bought another one as a gift .
p6565
aVI hope this helps .

VGorgeous , just gorgeous .
p6568
aVThe images just plain `` look '' better than any digital photo I have taken over the last 12 years .
p6569
aVAnything I shoot looks great whether it 's a portrait , a landscape , the sky , a bannana or the texture of my house eave - I ca n't find anything it does n't capture with the quality and detail that makes it a piece of art .
p6570
aVMy 1st beef is that the display on the camera itself is better than any of my 6 laptop or pc displays or my HD flatscreen TV 's .
p6571
aVMy second beef is that I now have to upgrade my laptop to manage and modify the monster files it creates whether raw , hi qual images or the HD video .
p6572
aVBy beef , of course I mean Bonus , since now I MUST upgrade : -RRB- I 'll end with simply , WOW and I am so glad I Pre-ordered the T2i instead of settling on the available -LRB- and also fabulous -RRB- T1i !
p6573
aVThank You Canon and Amazon !
p6574
aa(lp6575
VI am a new DSLR user and have been completely blown away with the quality of pictures and the convenience of HD video of this camera -LRB- 18 - 135 lens -RRB- !
p6576
aVGreat camera for a great price !
p6577

VThis one , and others break .
p6579
aVThey break without warning , and you are out 500 to 800 dollars .
p6580

VWhat I liked about this camera is that it is fairly easy to use and has several good options , such as candle lighting , which can make for some nice low-light photos with warmer tones .
p6583
aVIf you are not a fan of the washed-out flourescent or flash bulb lighting , you might like this feature .
p6584
aVOutdoor photos were crisp and rendered fairly accurate colors .
p6585
aVWhat I did not like about the camera , though , is that the autofocus on the zoom lens is horribly slow , making it almost impossible to use in rooms that are not well lit .
p6586
aVThe regular lens is not great with this either .
p6587
aVIn low-light there is a significant amount noise , and the flash is not very powerful , so I would recommend buying a seperate one .
p6588
aVAlso , in the white areas of several photos the camera placed white dots on the brightest spots , such as the whites of eyes and teeth .
p6589
aVThis was very annoying and time - consuming to correct in photoshop .
p6590
aVThe last feature I did not like is the bulky design and weight of the camera .
p6591
aVThis is definitely not a camera to travel with .
p6592
aa(lp6593
VI knew this was not going to be a `` professional '' quality type of camera .
p6594
aVI just wanted some nice looking pictures without going to a pro .
p6595
aVI got a great deal , but I got what I paid for .
p6596
aVI have a lot to figure out on the camera and that is a good thing .
p6597
aVI wanted more options , but not necessarily all the manual demands .
p6598
aVI do n't mind it being more automatic .
p6599
aVI just want to push a button and click .
p6600
aVI viewed the pictures others had shared and I am excited to do some pictures like that .
p6601
aVI think I really will enjoy making my own , nice pictures .
p6602
aa(lp6603
VI love my little Elph .
p6604
aVIt has a fantastic zoom and takes great indoor and outdoor photos .
p6605
aVNot the greatest for the dark or action shots , but compared to other small pocket cameras , this one is pretty dang good .
p6606
aVWould recommend it .
p6607
aa(lp6608
Vvery good miniDv Digital Video Camcorder in that price range -LRB- ... -RRB- .
p6609
aVThe unit is very light 1.3 lb .
p6610
aVOutdoor video is pretty good , but indoor is n't .
p6611
aVIncluded battery is only for 30 minutes recoeding with LCD on .
p6612
aVRemote control in very ugly , AC adaptor\u005c/charger and other accessaries are very rough , not Japan-made , the unit is just fine .
p6613
aVNot 0 Lux , so video is terrible in weak light , the build-in light is useless at all in this case .
p6614
aVI did not try still image mode , 640x480 VGA is not good enough for printing .
p6615
aVInclude software is for Win95\u005c/98 only , not for NT\u005c/2000 .
p6616
aVThe indoor recording video is `` red '' , you need to calabriate to write-balance to reduce this ugly effect .
p6617
aVSummary : it is good enough for home use , but video and audio quality is just fair .
p6618
aa(lp6619
VI purchased this camera to use with my previous church 's media ministry , based on my trial use of the VX2000 .
p6620
aVThat was three years ago .
p6621
aVThis camera is STILL running as well as it did when I bought it .
p6622
aVI use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and DVD production , plus , I get great digital audio recordings when I plug directly into my current church 's sound system .
p6623
aVThe ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible .
p6624
aVNow that I am creating a multimedia team for our church , I 've convinced the church to buy one for themselves .
p6625
aa(lp6626
VIt 's a great little thing .
p6627
aVEverything what you can ask for .
p6628
aVSmall , light and brill quality !
p6629
aa(lp6630
VThis is a good handycam .
p6631
aVThe Image stability is very good .
p6632
aVIt have enough space -LRB- memory -RRB- to capture a days events .
p6633
aVThe wide-angle is very useful for natural scenic locations .
p6634
aVRecommend to have a spare battery .
p6635
aVThe software helps you to organise your photo and video collection .
p6636

Vok so i got this video camera for Christmas of 2010 .
p6638
aVas soon as i took it out of the package and charged it , it would n't turn on .
p6639
aVi sent it back in and they sent me a new one within 3 to 4 days .
p6640
aVit work til October 30th and it did the same thing it did before -LRB- didnt turn on -RRB- .
p6641
aVpicture was good but it did n't have long battery life .
p6642
aVif u want a god video camera do n't buy the Flip Mino video camera .
p6643
aa(lp6644
VI 've never owned a Sony camera before ; I may never own one again : I enjoyed the ease of use , and the picture quality was good for a point-and-shoot camera .
p6645
aVI also really liked that it 's smaller than a smartphone and easy to carry around in my pocket .
p6646
aVHOWEVER , right after the 1-yr warranty expired -LRB- 13 months to be exact -RRB- the lens malfunctioned and it no longer takes pictures .
p6647
aVIt just displays a message on the screen indicating a fatal error .
p6648
aVI 'm very disappointed in the quality of this camera .
p6649
aVSony said it will cost more than $ 100 to repair it , which is something I 'm not willing to do out of principal .
p6650
aVSummary : $ 200 retail $ 110 repair after one year = $ 310 for a simple point-and-shoot camera .
p6651
aVMaybe this one was a lemon , but this camera turned out to be a disappointment and was n't worth the money .
p6652
aa(lp6653
VI purchased the Flip for the birth of my first baby and it arrived in the mail right on time !
p6654
aVHowever , being very busy first time parents , we 've only used the camera a handful of times and for short periods .
p6655
aVThe battery will not hold a charge , at all !
p6656
aVWe 've missed a few `` firsts '' from our baby simply because our fully charged camera died right while recording video 's .
p6657
aVMy husband and I are very disappointed with this purchase and will not purchase any more products from Flip .
p6658
aVUnfortunately , we did waste $ 150 + tax and shipping .
p6659
aa(lp6660
VI bought this camera for my 10 year old .
p6661
aVSo far , so good .
p6662
aVShe even tested it out in our bathtub and it still works .
p6663
aVIt has a lot of great features and options , more than I expected .
p6664
aVAppears to be a great value in my opinion as far as point and shoot camera go .
p6665
aa(lp6666
VBought this item because it was highly rated in Consumersearch .
p6667
aVUsed the binoculars less than 10 times and was removing the eyepiece cap and the right eyecup came off -LRB- this happened yesterday -RRB- .
p6668
aVTried to reattach it but could not .
p6669
aVThese binoculars reportedly have a good warranty , so am hoping that when I contact Nikon I will be able upgrade this review .
p6670
aVPrior to the eyecup problem , I was satisfied with the product .
p6671
aa(lp6672
VI will start the review with a disclaimer that I had the chance to beta-test this camera before release ; That also means I have had a few months experience in shooting with the camera .
p6673
aVI will start out with a little history .
p6674
aVA few years ago , Sigma released the SD-9 and SD-10 digital cameras .
p6675
aVThey were widely hailed to have excellent image quality , but the trouble for some buyers was that the cameras did not have some convinced features that other cameras offered , like in-camera JPEG or on-camera flash , and so they went on to other systems .
p6676
aVFast forward to today and the SD-14 .
p6677
aVSigma has addressed all the little aspects of usability and features that people have asked for , like in-camera JPEG , on camera flash , PC-Sync socket , and many other little features .
p6678
aVBut best of all , in addition to adding more resolution , they also improved the image quality from the sensor even further - the camera has even more dynamic range , and much better high ISO support than before with everything up to 800 working really well and even 1600 being usable .
p6679
aVThis is a camera with a feature set that just about anyone can make use of , and leave the choice of the body to image quality rather than body features .
p6680
aVWhen considering a camera like the SD-14 , it really is important to understand the difference the Foveon sensor makes as this camera really is different than any other camera on the market today .
p6681
aVLook at sample images -LRB- look at full-size sample images , not shrunken down web versions ! -RRB-
p6682
aV.
p6683
aVRead about the Foveon sensor .
p6684
aVThe use that information to make up your mind if this is the right camera for you .
p6685
aVFor fine art work or landscapes , I 'm really not sure there is anything better .
p6686
aVSigma deserves a lot of credit for daring to continue updating the camera line with this unique sensor in a market full of otherwise very similar choices -LRB- except for Fuji , props there -RRB- .
p6687
aVYou can read more here about the Foveon and Bayer sensors compared in terms of detail captured and the information about resolution charts you should know : -LRB- ... -RRB- And you can find full-size sample images either on the Sigma-sd14 .
p6688
aVcom web site or here in the user galleries : -LRB- ... -RRB-
p6689
aa(lp6690
VSanta got this for my daughter .
p6691
aVIt 's very thin , nice looking , easy to figure out and takes amazingly good shots .
p6692
aVA big step up from my old point-and-shoot ; not the caliber of my SLR , but I would n't expect that .
p6693
aVDoes quite well in lower light .
p6694
aVA great value .
p6695
aVCanon always made a good camera and this one does n't disappoint -- and it 's so inexpensive there 's practically no risk in buying one .
p6696
aa(lp6697
VThis little kit is a fun beginning into a journey of lomography .
p6698
aVIt comes with a booklet of artwork from other artists who used the style of photography , and is worth the price of the whole kit by itself .
p6699
aVThe camera and accessories are all included and are everything you need to get started .
p6700
aa(lp6701
Vthe camera is good .
p6702
aVthe IA function is nice .
p6703
aVLike others say , it could do much better in low lighting situations .
p6704
aVthe picture in low light is good only if you use a tripod -LRB- or similar -RRB- and the timer .
p6705
aVwhen traveling is not always possible to find a flat spot to put the camera .
p6706
aVYou can also play with different knobs for low lighting .
p6707
aVeverything else seems to be really good so far .
p6708
aVOverall a good camera

aVOverall , as an occasional user , I consider the Mustek DV4000 good value for money .
p6715
aVAlthough some of the printed data may look very promising , please , do not expect the video resolution associated with some of the more expensive cameras .

VI wanted a camera that was more portable than my 7D for those times when the 7D plus lens and speed light take up to much space -LRB- e.g. in a restaurant -RRB- .
p6812
aVIt was a great camera to take to the beach on a recent trip to Hawaii .
p6813
aVThis camera is not a 7D but comes acceptably close .
p6814
aVI produces high quality RAW or JPG images in AV and Auto mode .
p6815
aVIt is compact and easy to carry .
p6816
aVThe recommended Case Logic case is a perfect fit for this camera and is padded to provide protection against damage to the camera .
p6817
aVI take great HD video .
p6818
aVThe recommended 16 GB card is more room that I need for the way I use this camera .
p6819
aVIf this was going to be my main camera and get lots of use in one shooting , I would defiantly order a second battery .
p6820
aVThe only negative about this camera , which was mentioned in all the reviews that I read , was the placement of the pop up flash which is located where the left index finger would naturally go .
p6821
aa(lp6822
VI bought these as a birthday gift for my daughter 's 9th birthday .
p6823
aVShe requested binoculars so I wanted to give her something that was durable , water resistant and with decent optics , but not for $ 75 - $ 100 .
p6824
aVThese seem to meet all those criteria .
p6825
aVI would be happy to use them for camping or at concerts .
p6826
aVThe only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is because I just do n't know how water resistant they are -- have n't been in the rain with them .
p6827

aV3 .
p6838
aVSeveral unique or difficult to find features .
p6839
aVFish eye lens - usually a very expensive option on other cameras .
p6840
aV`` Rear curtain '' sync flash - usually only found on very expensive cameras .
p6841
aV`` B '' setting - not common on view finder cameras .
p6842
aVDouble exposure - extremely rare on manual advance cameras .
p6843
aVNegative : Because of the location of the built-in flash and the size of the lens , extremely close up flash pictures will contain an annoying shadow caused by the lens housing .
p6844
aVYou can avoid this by using a flash mounted in the hot shoe or a lens mounted ring flash .
p6845
aVThis is a satisfactory solution because I never use the hot shoe mounted viewer and I prefer to use my ColorSplash flash with this camera anyway .
p6846
aVInteresting : The top and bottom of the circular image are cut off .
p6847
aVMaybe it would be nicer if the entire image fit within the rectangular frame of the film , but then the picture would be smaller , so this is probably OK .
p6848
aVI usually crop the picture to be square anyway , or possibly crop a rectangular image out of the middle of the circular image , so this is n't really a problem .
p6849
aVOverall : I love this camera .

p6863

aVSince I am already a Nikon owner , I have several lenses and an excellent Nikon lighting system , Battery grips , etc. so upgrading to this camera was exciting !
p6867
aVAs soon as it gets dark this camera show off it 's high ISO Much better than the D-300 .
p6868
aVThe video at night is awesome .
p6869
aVTake a look on YouTube `` Nikon D-7000 Low Light Video '' Very impressive .
p6870
aVI am pleased with my purchase of this camera and is about $ 500 less than the D-300 with Video and a whopping 16.2 mp .

VI was considering an 8x40 or 10x50 but there is very little -LRB- if any -RRB- differance .
p6874
aVIts the size and almost equal magnification and brightness as compared side by side that convinced me .
p6875
aVFantastic product , Nikon .
p6876
aa(lp6877
VI purchased this for my photography enthusiast wife for Christmas .
p6878
aVI saw the same exact item in various stores for about $ 25 and got in on Amazon for only $ 8 , hoping it would be the same thing .
p6879
aVIt was !
p6880
aVShe said it works wonderfully and was as easy to set up as plugging it in .
p6881
aVGreat Value !
p6882
aa(lp6883
VI bought this video camera 5 years ago .
p6884
aVlet me tell you , it is still working great .
p6885
aVI have never had problems with it .
p6886
aVI thoight I might need a new updated version , but I didnt .
p6887
aVI went to my daughters play in school .
p6888
aVI ended up sitting in the last row .
p6889
aVI thought that the video would be bad ... that I was too far away .
p6890
aVbut The video came out fine ... I was able to zoom into her little face .
p6891
aVPoor thing ... she was in the back where they put the not so good performers .
p6892
aVThe camera has zoom , fade in and out , list messages to put on screen , if you lost the cassette adapter like i did you can hook it up to the AV cables in your tv .
p6893
aa(lp6894
VThe Camera Does a Good Job taking Pictures , as long as you do n't turn on the Digital Zoom .
p6895
aVIf You go into Full Zoom With Digital the pictures get grainy .
p6896
aVBattery Life is short in the Movie mode it seems long in the Picture Mode .
p6897
aVIf you like to text stamp your pictures it reduces pictures megapixils down to 2or3 to stamp them and only after the picture has been takin why ?
p6898
aV-LRB- The Owners manual claims its been found that generic battery circuts are not regulated as well as panasonic battery therefore they will not warrenty it if it has damage due to using a generic battery -RRB- Does that sound like a scare sales tactic to buy only panasonic .
p6899
aVFor twice the price approx $ 50.00 way to high .
p6900
aVIve owned many cameras and used generics with no trouble 97 % of the time .
p6901
aVMovie mode has no AVI its Mpeg2 Quicktime and a Very unfriendly format Avchd Lite .
p6902
aVThe cameras price at this time is $ 290.00 good luck .
p6903
aa(lp6904
VEasy to use and the dock is great for syncing and charging the camera .
p6905
aVWe use it at our office to photograph patients for our electronic chart and we get great results and its easy to use .
p6906
aa(lp6907
VI bought this camera in February to use as a backup to my Nikon D2X , and to use when I wanted to schlepp around a slightly smaller , less weighty camera body .
p6908
aVInstead , I found myself splitting my usage between the D2X and D200 almost evenly , because this camera has most of the important features of the D2X at one-third the price .
p6909
aVI 'm not afraid of using the D200 even when image quality is paramount , because I find it difficult to detect much of a difference between the 10.2 MP files of this camera and the 12.4 MP output of my D2X .
p6910
aVThe D200 is even quite acceptable for sports , as its autofocus is admirably fast , and its 5 fps bursts satisfactory for anything short of the D2X 's 8 fps high speed crop mode .
p6911
aVApparently Nikon had solved the `` banding '' issue by February , as I am unable to detect any banding in my D200 .
p6912
aVAlthough the minority of users who experienced this issue were quite vocal , it seems that they were , in fact , a minority .
p6913
aVI recommend this camera as a pro-level camera for anyone who does n't specifically need one of the D2Xs 's more advanced features .
p6914
aa(lp6915
VSimply great , easy to use , great pictures , fully loaded , a very fun camera for amateurs photographers
p6916
aa(lp6917
VI bought this camera as a gift for my husband a year or so ago , and we have been SO happy with it .
p6918
aVIt is an excellent first SLR camera ; the photos we have gotten are amazing , and neither of us has any formal training .
p6919
aVI even used this camera to photograph my brother 's informal BBQ wedding , with wonderful results .
p6920
aVI 've taken hundreds of photos with this camera , covering all types of photography -LRB- candids , portraits , nature etc -RRB- , and the number that have turned out badly is incredibly small .
p6921
aVI have been so grateful to have it for family moments and trips -LRB- particularly my honeymoon -RRB- .
p6922
aVFor the price it has a pretty good shutter speed ; rarely have I missed a photo because the camera was too slow .
p6923
aVIt even does sports etc relatively well ; my husband has used it at football games and I even used it to capture several good shots of someone doing backflips .
p6924
aVIt seems that most of the negative reviews are expecting way too much .
p6925
aVI do n't think this was ever meant to be for professionals , and you honestly get what you pay for .
p6926
aVIt was meant for people , like me , who wanted a better quality photo than a point-and-shoot and\u005c/or to start a hobby .
p6927
aVIf you 're looking for a truly professional camera , break out the checkbook and go for a better model .
p6928
aVIf you want to take photos of your kids or your flower garden that look better than your friends $ 100 point and shoot , this will satisfy you .
p6929
aVI do highly recommend a telephoto lens to go with it ; the website we bought it from had a special promotion that included a telephoto and it has been WONDERFUL .
p6930
aVAt zoos and on our honeymoon to the Carribean we have taken photos with the telephoto that look like they belong in a nature magazine .
p6931
aVI highly recommend that you consider investing in a telephoto lens as well as the camera if you are considering any traveling or if you like nature photos .
p6932
aVHowever , the lens that comes with it does an excellent job in and of itself if you can not currently afford a second lens , it just wo n't allow you the distance that a telephoto will .
p6933
aVI also recommend a good photo editing software ; while the camera does an amazing job on its own , the edited portraits we have created with software go above and beyond .
p6934
aVIf you ca n't afford something like photoshop I recommend a FREE software named GIMP , which you can find just by an internet search - it has a lot of wonderful features , you just may have to read a guide or watch a how-to-video to figure out how to use some of the features .
p6935
aa(lp6936
VI purchased this camera as an upgrade from my point and shoot to a -RRB- take better pictures and 2 -RRB- actually learn how to take pictures .
p6937
aVIt is well priced so that it 's not a huge investment .
p6938
aVIf I realized that I have no real interest in becoming a better photographer then I can at least take better pictures .
p6939
aVIf after my intro photography classes , I decided to pursue it as a long term hobby then I 'll probably upgrade again ... but I 'm pretty sure that wo n't happen for awhile .
p6940
aVI thought not having a liveview would bother me ... it really does n't make a difference to me .
p6941
aVOverall , I 'd recommend it to my `` I have a budding interest in photography '' friends .
p6942
aa(lp6943
VI love my S2 IS , pictures are awesome .
p6944
aVI always go to the car racers in Englishtown NJ , and with the zoom of this camera i do n't have to be close to the action anymore .
p6945
aVThe movie mode is great too , just wish it lasted longer than 8 minutes at the highest settings .
p6946
aVNo problems at all so far , knock on wood , you will love this camera , A + in my book .
p6947
aa(lp6948
Vafter six months of use it 's one of the best handycam i ever tried , you just need to get an extra battery and of course a touch screen protector .
p6949
aVupdate : Now it 's almost 18 month with this handycam , i love it , its simple so my kids can use it with the easy button and for the professional you still can go deeper in the setting and set it .
p6950
aVit worth every penny i paid for it .
p6951
aa(lp6952
VThe first camera I received was not working properly and was returned to the vendor .
p6953
aVThe vendor was very helpful and quickly replaced the product .
p6954
aVI shot some photos with it soon thereafter and I am pleased with the results .
p6955
aVI think a wrist strap should be supplied with the camera instead of a neck strap otherwise , I am happy with the purchase .
p6956
aa(lp6957
VThe PICSIO seem a little light and not very sturdy .
p6958
aVMy brother 's flip was much better made .
p6959
aVI compare his Flip mino HD during dinner and both the quality of the Flip and the ability to take videos in low light rooms was easily bettered by the Flip .
p6960
aVMy vidoes on the PICSIO in low light was extremely grainy but on the Flip was 5-6 times better .
p6961
aVIf you plan on using the PICSIO in well lit areas it is probably ok but in low light the Flip wins hands down .
p6962
aVOne more thing , people with fingers larger than a childs should use the Flip .
p6963
aVThe power button is hard to push .
p6964
aVI ended up returning the PICSIO and getting the Flip ; much happier now .
p6965
aVEven better my Flip mino HD was $ 20 less .
p6966
aVI purchased it for $ 159 on amazon .
p6967
aVAmazon took back my PICSIO return and gave me full credit .
p6968
aVThis is the way to shop for Christmas !
p6969
aa(lp6970
VI 've been reading reviews here and it seems clear to me that the problem I 'm having with my ZR10 is all too common .
p6971
aVMy camera started acting up and I thought it was just a dirty head .
p6972
aVSo I cleaned it .
p6973
aVThat did n't help .
p6974
aVNow it too has started eating tapes and wo n't record or play , at least not consistently .
p6975
aVI own a beautiful Canon EOS Elan II which works flawlessly .
p6976
aVCan anyone recommend a DEPENDABLE video camera ?
p6977
aa(lp6978
VIf you 're a gadget person , you 'll love this .
p6979
aVIf you 're looking to film the next `` Titanic '' , do n't buy it .
p6980
aVIt 's great fun , easy to use but it is not an $ 800 camcorder .
p6981
aVI suggest rechargeable batteries though , it goes through the regular pretty quick -- especially if you play with it as much as I do .
p6982
aVThe video can be dark indoors so turn on the lights !!
p6983
aa(lp6984
VI had been using my brothers DMC-FZ40 , and I decided to buy the DMC-FZ35 because its cheaper , and I love it .
p6985
aV.
p6986
aVBoth are great buys , but if your on a budget , get the 35 , you wont notice the difference .
p6987
aV.
p6988
aVSuch a great camera with so many features .
p6989
aV.
p6990
aVIm still learning ... I give it 3 thumbs up ...
p6991
aa(lp6992
VSadly Pentax discontinued this model in favor of their new flagship MZ-S .
p6993
aVLet me tell you they 're different cameras .
p6994
aVWhile the MZ-S is a fully pro- oriented body , PZ-1p is an outstanding all-around gear .
p6995
aVIt has many features only found in great great Canon or Nikon models , obviously much higher priced .
p6996
aVExamples of this is its 4 fps drive motor , 1\u005c/8000 top shutter speed , or 1\u005c/250 flash sync , and interchangeable focusing screens .
p6997
aVAnother great feature is the so-called Hyper Program mode , that allows the user to switch from a full programmed mode to an aperture-priority -LRB- or shutter-priority -RRB- just by moving the aperture -LRB- or shutter-speed -RRB- knob .
p6998
aVOr the Hyper Manual mode , when you have total exposure control , but can ask the camera to aid you setting the proper exposure with a touch of a button .
p6999
aVLCD display is large enough to be clearly seen from a meter away , and shows any information you need .
p7000
aVIt can be backlit at the touch of two simultaneous buttons .
p7001
aVAlmost every info in this display is available at the viewfinder right side also .
p7002
aVBuild is good enough for an all-around body .
p7003
aVIt is not air tight and it has not 72 molybdene silicon-rubbered-thermo gaskets just because it is not intended for carrying it during an Everest climb .
p7004
aVBut any photographer can safely rely on it for almost every kind of work .
p7005
aVBody is metal-carbonate compound , and unlike some mass-market models from a very renowned brand , it has a metal -LRB- not hard plastic -RRB- lens mount .
p7006
aVAdd to this the fact that remarkably puts Pentax above any SLR manufacturer : lens compatibility .
p7007
aVYou can use PZ-1p - along as ANY modern Pentax body - with ANY K-mount lens you can get .
p7008
aVOf course you 'll not enjoy the autofocus feature with old lenses , but you can set the PZ-1p to aid your manual focus with a mark on the viewfinder and\u005c/or a beep sound .
p7009
aVTry to find that feature in any other of the great SLR brands .
p7010
aVJust forget about ... So , if you own an old faithful K-1000 with a couple of reliable and solid SMC lenses and want to enter a new photographic era , stop thinking about : this is the camera for you .
p7011
aV...
p7012
aa(lp7013
VI bought this camera , and it arrived really fast !
p7014
aVI had problems loading the film , but they had a great customer support line and I figured it out really fast .
p7015
aVIt is so different than an ordinary camera , and also very fun and experimental !
p7016
aa(lp7017
VI finally have a place to discuss my terrible dislike of this camcorder and service from Panasonic .
p7018
aVWe bought this camera 3 years ago and it never worked right from the start .
p7019
aVOne of the reasons we bought it was for the built in digital camera .
p7020
aVWell my 2 year old son could draw a picture better than the quality it produces .
p7021
aVThe interface to my computer to upload the camera never worked right and Panasonic was never able to properly troubleshoot the issue .
p7022
aVWell my warranty ran out about 3 months ago -LRB- had 3 year warranty -RRB- and would n't you know that it stopped working .
p7023
aVNever dropped , hit or nothing and the day of my son 's 2nd bday , I went to put tape in and the thing kept humming and spinning the tape but not recording .
p7024
aVNot worth having fixed as I heard terrible things about Panasonic customer service , so I am going to buy a new one now !
p7025
aa(lp7026
VSoft , blurry edges with strong chromatic distortion - pretty much what you 'd expect for the price .
p7027
aVProbably fine for a point  shoot up to 8x .
p7028
aVUsing the lens with anything stronger than 200mm will reveal the poor quality .
p7029
aa(lp7030
Vthe camera is good , but someday I take the number six picture and the camera never work again , today nobody fix this camera .
p7031
aVBut I still thinking the camera is very good , the pictures was clear and high colors , I 'm use this camera only twice .
p7032
aa(lp7033
VThis is an amazing camera !
p7034
aVI 'm having so much fun learning how everything works , and taking some fantastic shots !
p7035
aVI waited and saved to get it , and I do n't regret one minute of the wait .
p7036
aVIt is well worth it .
p7037
aVThank you .
p7038
aa(lp7039
VI 'm sure the telescope itself works great , and they did deliver it on time and in great condition .
p7040
aVHowever just in case you were ordering this as a gift , .
p7041
aV.
p7042
aVthe label and the package are clearly marked with what 's inside , so the surprise was ruined when my husband found it on the front doorstep .
p7043
aV= -LRB-
p7044
aa(lp7045
VThis is a really good camcorder .
p7046
aVI had it for a few month now and love every bit of it .
p7047
aVThe picture quality is flawless on my hd tv .
p7048
aa(lp7049
VI do n't know much about cameras , I just want to be able to record or take pictures for events and such .
p7050
aVThis camera is perfect for that .
p7051
aVI love the small design , it 's very easy to handle .
p7052
aVMy only beef is that this camera does not do well in low light .
p7053
aVUnless its the middle of the day and I have all my curtains open , it was impossible to get a good picture inside the house. , I 've only had my camera a month and I 'm still getting to know my camera , but other than the lighting , I am very happy with my purchase .
p7054
aa(lp7055
VA little small is my first impression but not something I ca n't get used to .
p7056
aVI 'd love to be able to capture an image I have zoomed in the camera but quality suffers there so it is not usually recommended .
p7057
aVAnd zooming would be more seamless were it so and not jumpy -LRB- as in the difference between digital and analog -RRB- .
p7058
aVAn eye cup would be nice to block out the real world while peeking thru my viewfinder .
p7059
aVI added the extension tube and lens shade which protects the front element of the lens and gives me something to hold onto when carrying the camera in my hand and shooting ; I 'm told it looks sexy as hell too -LRB- wish that rubbed off on the holder -RRB- .
p7060
aVBut as a sometimes pro and addicted shooter -LRB- hundreds of exposures a day - some friends tell me they sometimes fail to recognize me at first without that black thing in front of my face .
p7061
aVI think it adds to my cuteness -RRB- I do really like it , tho the stabilizer leaves something to be desired .
p7062
aVI still love the heft of the Sony 717 and use it often but not as much as I used to .
p7063
aVThe Sony T50 would be the next addition to my stable of cameras .
p7064
aVApril 2012 : I sold the S3 to a friend and got the S5 .
p7065
aVBig improvement but the camera was still too busy for me so I gave it my daughter for High School graduation and she 's still using it .
p7066
aVI now own an Sony TX1 which is always in my pocket , a Canon 20D , rarely used and a new Sony HX200v with which I will make a coupla hundred exposures a day .
p7067
aVAnything short of DSLR is just that but I can make great pictures with a Diana , and have .
p7068
aVBeen doing it over half a century ... practice , practice , practice .
p7069
aV-LRB- bought all cameras from or thru Amazon , except the 20d which was a gift -RRB-
p7070
aa(lp7071
VThis was my first digital camera .
p7072
aVI was a VERY hard sell .
p7073
aVI already had my 35mm , and I wanted no parts of a $ 200 + camera whose pictures I could only see on a computer .
p7074
aVWhat a rip off !
p7075
aVThen I went to a very famous landmark , and discovered it was too dark to see its stunning features in the photos that came back .
p7076
aVI still was n't a willing adapter , but I was willing to consider maybe a digital camera could have been helpful here .
p7077
aVSo after going through tons of camera reviews , I took the plunge and bought this Canon A710 in mid March 2007 .
p7078
aVThis is still one of my best purchases .
p7079
aVI still do n't think it would have made those pictures on that particular trip come out better , but for everything else : Excellent .
p7080
aVPlus , that whole computer business turned out to be a benefit : I no longer have to worry about where to store all those glossy little prints , as much as I like being able to touch them physically .
p7081
aVI can also print them out several times if necessary .
p7082
aVPlus mailing paper is a whole lot easier than mailing photos .
p7083
aVAnd for all those graphic text editing programs that lets you add your own pictures and colors , a digital camera is the perfect complement to create wonderful designs .
p7084
aVI easily used my pictures from the digital camera as a screensaver on my computer , and even had a guy who takes pictures as a side business ask me what -LRB- high priced -RRB- equipment I used to get such great results .
p7085
aVJust this Canon A710 .
p7086
aV-LRB- now I really DO sound like ad ; and no I 'm not being paid ! -RRB-
p7087
aVAnd if things could n't get better , the software automatically loaded my pictures by date in my chosen folder .
p7088
aVNICE !
p7089
aVUnfortunately , all good things on this earth must end .
p7090
aVIn November 2010 , my camera started having minor problems -LRB- something caused the shutter not to close completely , disk temporarily claimed no pictures were on it , pictures temporarily would n't load correctly to the computer , slight degradation of picture quality , etc -RRB- I know that digital items tend to fail more catastrophically than analog , and with less warning time , so I very reluctantly started looking for a replacement .
p7091
aVFortunately , the camera was still taking very good pictures , so I still had a good deal of time before the replacement became a necessity .
p7092
aVUnfortunately , I broke the cardinal rule of non-weather\u005c/water-proof digital cameras : DO N'T USE IN RAIN .
p7093
aVAfter that incident , the bottom left side of all the rest of my pictures blurred .
p7094
aVFortunately by then , I had found a new camera .
p7095
aVHowever , by now , any new camera will always be compared to the features of this A710 Canon .
p7096
aVThe NEW camera requires special batteries , instead of the AA 's the canon took .
p7097
aVThe NEW camera is all touchscreen , while canon had manual dials -LRB- do n't think this is a problem , try to select an option with sweaty or dirty fingers -RRB- .
p7098
aVThe NEW camera does n't have a separate view finder like the canon did .
p7099
aVThe NEW camera only zooms 8X , instead of the digital 24X that the canon did .
p7100
aVThe NEW camera 's PC software does n't organize by date like the canon did .
p7101
aVThe NEW camera 's pictures do n't image as well as the canon does .
p7102
aVyada , yada , yada .
p7103
aVSo we 're clear : the NEW camera is NOT a canon ; I 'll live .
p7104
aVBut sometimes you do n't really appreciate what you have until it 's gone .
p7105
aVYes it had faults , like the lag time between consecutive pictures could be up to 10 seconds .
p7106
aVOr in misty conditions , the camera focuses on the water droplets in the air instead of the scene .
p7107
aVOr that it cost ~ $ 250 while the NEW camera was only ~ $ 145 with upgraded features .
p7108
aVBut that being said , it was a REALLY good camera , and served me well for almost 5 years .
p7109
aa(lp7110
VThere is an old saying in photography that the best camera for the job is the one you have with you .
p7111
aVThe Canon4 S90 does a lot of things very well and the ring around the lens with its helpful custom features makes it a joy to use under a variety of shooting conditions .
p7112
aVHowever what makes this small camera really stand out is its combination of very high picture taking quality AND portability .
p7113
aVI carry mine in a slick secure little cell phone holder made by NiteIze .
p7114
aVWith my little shooter constantly on my belt I always have my chance for a decisive moment that can be rendered beautifully by the S90 .
p7115
aa(lp7116
VI purchased this camera for the great telephoto lens .
p7117
aVIt is great to use when you do n't want to carry a camera and all the different lenses on different shoots as it gets very heavy .
p7118
aVOf course , do n't expect to take pictures as fast as you would with the Canon EOS cameras .
p7119
aVGreat little camera for the price .
p7120
aVI have shown my camera to two other people who ordered one for themselves and they seem to be happy with it .
p7121
aa(lp7122
VI purchased this camera in January intending to use it for an April trip to Hawaii .
p7123
aVI 've returned the camera twice for warranty repairs for the same problem .
p7124
aVIn fact , after three months the camera 's has spent more time under repair than with me .
p7125
aVThe problem appears to be a lens block which wo n't open rendering the camera useless for taking pictures .
p7126
aVIn the latest fix , I received the camera on Friday after the second repair and error appeared the next day as I was trying to take picures at a daughers event .
p7127
aVI 'm disappoined in both the quality of the camera and the quality of the warranty repair service .
p7128
aa(lp7129
VI 've read most of the reviews about this camera and agree withe the 5 star reviews .
p7130
aVThis is my first dslr camera so most camera 's in this price range would have been great to me .
p7131
aVI currently own a canon G12 .
p7132
aVI 'm amazed how easy it is to take pictures due to the greatly reduced shutter lag .
p7133
aVThe controls are user friendly .
p7134
aVWish I could add more .
p7135
aa(lp7136
VI love this small camera .
p7137
aVI especially like that you can take 3 shots at different exposures and the convert to HDR .
p7138
aVJust do n't buy the external viewfinder .
p7139

VWhile the Pansonic D-SNAP has the potential for usable video quality , you need to realize that it is going to take atleast an additional $ 799 card to make it functional .
p7147
aVTo reach a useful quality , the D-SNAP uses a high speed Panasonic version of the SD card , which is now available as a special version 32x SD card by other sources .
p7148
aVToday , people try to get the best price for a 30 - 60 minute DV tape at $ 5 .
p7149
aVWith the D-SNAP , you 'll be shopping for a $ 799 32x SD card , with 1 gig of storage , so you can move from 10 minutes of video to a whopping 20 minutes -LRB- which really is the bare minimum -RRB- at $ 799 .
p7150
aVAlso , beware that the manual is clear that the high speed write times will wear down the card , and you need to run special procedures to help reduce the errors which will start occurring .

aVIt also comes with a 512kb card , BUT it achieves 20 minutes of DVD-like quality or 45 minutes of VHS-like quality -LRB- which is very good -RRB- , out of the box .

aVIt uses more recent compression technology to write at multi-mb speeds on a normal SD card .
p7160
aVYou even get 30 frames per second to meet your 360 \u005c* 240 PC requirements , which provides more than an hour of video .

VIn an ideal world this camera would also have some sort of fisheye lens so that it could be comparable to the Go Pro Hero .
p7168
aVStill I 'd say that at half the price it takes seemingly the same quality of video and does n't require any additional waterproof housing .
p7169
aVI 've used this camera for taking underwater footage , going on hikes in the mountains , and just filming stuff around the house .
p7170
aVIt performs well in each situation and has a surprisingly good microphone for how small and waterproof it is .
p7171
aVThe screen on back is n't huge but you do n't ever have to manually focus so I would n't worry about that too much .
p7172
aVAlthough it can film in 1080p , remember that you 're buying a camera that costs $ 100 , meaning the lens itself is probably worth about $ 10 .
p7173
aVSo do n't expect it to look as good as the stuff you see coming out of your blu ray player .
p7174
aVIt looks good enough for youtube and you will even be pleasantly surprised how good it looks on your HDtv , but it 's much closer to an iphone video camera than it is to a true video camera .
p7175
aVI would definitely recommend it based on durability\u005c/quality\u005c/and the fact that you can hand it to pretty much anyone born after World War 1 and they can figure out how to use it .

VI owned Canon HV20 camcorder , and its quality is doubtlessly excellent .
p7180
aVMoving from HV20 to Kodak Zi8 , I do n't expect much of anything .
p7181
aVHow can you compare a $ 700 camcorder with a $ 150 Kodak Zi8 ?
p7182
aVLet me tell you that I am totally surprised .
p7183
aVAfter upgrading the firmware to 1.06 -LRB- which you can find on Kodak website -RRB- , the gap is even closer .
p7184
aVThe only difference that I notice on my Samsung HDTV is that Zi8 has slightly more noisy than HV20 ; to some , it might be bothering , to me it is very acceptable .
p7185
aVSome tips : when you videotape a scene , and you move the Zi8 , move it slowly ; if you do it to fast , it can look blurry .
p7186
aVThis is something that you will pick up as soon as you own one .
p7187
aVFor the price , portability , and functionality , I do n't see why average users like me should not go with this Zi8 .
p7188
aVAs a previous owner of Canon HV20 camcorder , all I can say is : I do n't really feel there is any significant difference .
p7189
aVOf course , I do n't say this as a professional .
p7190
aVThe professionals will be able to tell you the differences .
p7191
aVIn short , if you consider of using Zi8 for home , outdoor , travel , and other casual uses , or even for family memories , you have come to the right product .
p7192
aVLook no further and enjoy !
p7193
aa(lp7194
VThis is my first camcorder of any kind .

aVi have used other types , VHS , VHS-C , 8mm , but this is probably the best that i have used .

p7200
aVThe NightShot is great , the lamp is really good , and the camera has a few little effects for the pictures .
p7201
aVNo big complaints except a remote would be nice for playback , and a colored viewfinder .
p7202
aVBut with a 3 '' color LCD screen , the chance that someone will use the viewfinder is small .
p7203
aVi recomend this camera to anyone who does n't want to spend a lot on a good quality camera .
p7204
aa(lp7205
VI like the idea of a compact waterproof video cam that does HD .
p7206
aVThis however , misses the mark and need lots of improvement before it 's anywhere worth buying .
p7207
aVThe battery life is unacceptable .
p7208
aVIt will not even last for 40 min of shoot -LRB- accumulative , not continuous . -RRB-
p7209
aVfor a water\u005c/weather proof cam , the option of changing battery in the field is not an option - think changing in snow to continue shooting ; opening the battery door will allow moisture , etc. in .
p7210
aVThe video quality is ok in very bright sunlight ; unusable indoors -LRB- in any lighting conditions -RRB- and totally useless at night - way too grainy .
p7211
aVMight as well use the video from your cell phone - similar quality ; worst than an iPhone vodeo .
p7212
aVCamera shake is expected of a small unit like this and motion-stabilizing does a really bad job .
p7213
aVExpect to stay still while shooting or be prepared to throw up when you playback your videos !
p7214
aVAnother feature that is horrible is the angle of the lens - way too narrow .
p7215
aVForget about using this indoors or in tight quarters .
p7216
aVOutdoors , to get most scenes in , you 'll have to step so far back that everything is really small in the fame .
p7217
aVWithout any zoom -LRB- only has digital zoom which tears up the picture quality -RRB- you 'll get images without any details .
p7218
aVIn summery , this camera is not worth purchasing until Kodak addresses all the above short-comings .

p7223
aV\u005c* Camera can show date and time over the image in the display but does NOT record it .
p7224
aVI will comment on features and facets that I think are significant or that are not done justice by the detailed specifications .
p7225
aVOf course , you can find out all this and more by downloading the pdf of the manual .

p7254
aV\u005c* Hot shoe does not appear to be `` hot , '' but it does allow mounting an external light or mic .
p7255
aV\u005c* Optical Image stabilization removes the little shakes and makes possible reasonably steady handheld telephoto shots as well as steady handheld moving the camera around .
p7256
aV\u005c* The infrared capability seems to be only for using the camera in VCR mode with the infrared remote .
p7257
aV\u005c* The cable-attached remote functions are record start\u005c/stop , zoom and photo shot .
p7258

p7289
aVRecently , I was at a rally in front of the White House .
p7290
aVI was very pleased with the results .
p7291
aVThe video quality is first-rate and the mic\u005c/sound is more than adequate .
p7292
aVIn fact , for some of my scenes , I was placed , via crowd control , pretty far away from the focus of the action .
p7293
aVYet , the zoom on the camcorder did its job in a remarkable fashion .
p7294
aVI found this camcorder very easy to use even for a first time right out of the box user .
p7295
aVKudos to Sony !
p7296
aa(lp7297
VI have always been a Canon girl but heard such good things about Nikon I thought I would give it a try .
p7298
aVI used to have a Canon Powershot , which I was very happy with , but kept upgrading until I got a professional-grade camera -LRB- Mark ii -RRB- .
p7299
aVI needed an inexpensive `` daily '' camera to keep in my purse and thought this looked like a good camera , especially after reading all of the reviews .
p7300
aVI used this Nikon at a concert and was about ready to chuck it across the building .
p7301
aVIt would freeze up and get confused when trying to focus on the performers .
p7302
aVI had to shut it down and turn it on again .
p7303
aVIf you have the lens cover on it will give you an error and you have to turn it on and off again .
p7304
aVThis is not necessary - if you ca n't see anything in the viewfinder the lens cap is obviously on !
p7305
aVAt one point it took an entire series of shots even though I only pushed the button once .
p7306
aVAt one point there was some kind of digital line appearing in a bunch of my pictures .
p7307
aVIf you are looking for a good quailty point and shoot camera , do n't waste your money - get a Canon Powershot !!
p7308
aa(lp7309
VI love this video camera - everyone is so impressed with it .
p7310
aVGreat picture , great battery life , fun to use underwater !
p7311
aVYou just ca n't beat this for the price - it 's AWESOME !
p7312
aa(lp7313
VPROS : When shot is composed with proper lighting , the image quality is fantastic and sharp .
p7314
aVI 've set the camera to Manual and used the Vivid setting and found this to be the most optimal setting for image quality .
p7315
aVColors are well saturated ... no take in mind , this is all with proper lighting and if the subject\u005c/subjects are close enough for this camera 's mediocre built-in flash .
p7316
aVCONS : After over 100 shots testing the image quality at each ISO setting in low light conditions , I 've found that anything over ISO 400 with the SD800 is VERY noisy .
p7317
aVIn fact , you can probably get away with the noise at ISO 800 if you do n't print anything larger than a 4x6 .
p7318
aVBut the noise is just unbearable and using post processing software will remove the noise at the expense of detail .
p7319
aVThe Image Stabilization is fine during most light conditions , but it does a really subpar job in an indoor environment .
p7320
aVOVERALL : I 'm impressed by this camera .
p7321
aVIt 's above average amongst most ot the point-and-shoot cameras I 've used in the past .
p7322
aVAs I said , this camera 's performance is like night and day in regards to lighting conditions .
p7323
aVMany people tend to expect DSLR results from a point and shoot , but that 's what this Canon SD800 IS is , a POINT-AND-SHOOT .
p7324
aVI have yet to see a P shooter have the equivalent result of an SLR or DSLR .
p7325
aVOf other P I 've tried that are not as expensive as the Canon SD800 , I would try Panasonic 's line of Lumix cameras .
p7326
aVSame great image quality minus the high price tag .
p7327
aa(lp7328
VThis camera takes crystal clear shots .
p7329
aVI have never used a camera so clear .
p7330
aVFor the money , you can not get a better camera .
p7331
aa(lp7332
VHi , I 'm an amateur who likes to take nice pictures .
p7333
aVI 've just got my brand new Canon EOS Rebel T2i body and gonna start trying it out soon .
p7334
aVWhile picking up my camera at the postoffice , I 've recommended it to a friend and i would also recommend it to everyone thinking seriously about buying a good DSLR camera .
p7335
aVWell , must say it 's not an entry level but an advanced photographer tool with lots of features and a clear friendly display .
p7336
aVI 'm very glad with my choice and looking forward to have some fun also to share some shots with you in the future .
p7337
aVI ` ts a wonderfull camera for my purpose and I realy like it .
p7338
aVLook me up on flickr - digabur
p7339
aa(lp7340
VI received this camera last Christmas and just love it .
p7341
aVBecause of its great perfomance and reliability , I recently purchased one for my 12 year old daughter .
p7342
aVShe loves it !
p7343
aa(lp7344
VSo far I am loving this Flip Camera .
p7345
aVI have an older first generation Flip that has been very reliable and wanted to upgrade to HD and image stabilization .
p7346
aVI was also wanting the 2 hour capacity .
p7347
aVBecause this Flip is HD , the videos do n't run as well on older computers , but the software has a built in fix for this problem .
p7348
aVOnly improvement I 'd like to see is more zoom .
p7349
aa(lp7350
VThis scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy .
p7351
aVHere 's why : 1 .
p7352
aVThe objective is too small , only 76 mm , 3.0 inches , so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe .
p7353
aVI suppose it is marginally adequate for the moon , but that is it .
p7354
aVThe planets will appear as very small disks .
p7355
aVOne will be able to see Saturn 's rings , but the image will be very small .
p7356
aVForget it for deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc. .
p7357
aV2 .
p7358
aVThe mount is a cheap one and will frustrate rather than aid the viewing .
p7359
aVA better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects .
p7360
aV3 .
p7361
aVThe 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope .
p7362
aVThe observer will find it hard to look through -LRB- very small eye opening -RRB- , and will in most cases cause blurred images .
p7363
aVThe 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece .
p7364
aVThe barlow is a 3x , which again is too powerful for this scope .
p7365
aVEven for the low price , do n't be enticed by this scope ; it has too many flaws .
p7366
aVSave your money for a larger scope with a better mount .
p7367
aVJim `` Konedog '' Koenig , astronomy buff
p7368
aa(lp7369
VI bought this and it worked twice .
p7370
aVAfter that .
p7371
aV.
p7372
aVit wont charge all the way ... It wont record and what it did record was very bad .
p7373
aVI left it charged up a whole day and still wouldnt connect to my pc .
p7374
aVwaste of money and its cheap ... the little tab also breaks off
p7375
aa(lp7376
VThis is a compact , easy-to-use , bring the fun back to photography camera that provides Canon 's photo quality in a lower cost , compact build .
p7377
aVA little bit bigger than the digital elphs , this camera still fits comfortably in a shirt or pant pocket .
p7378
aVThe feature set is very basic , and nothing new .
p7379
aVIt has a `` Face select '' feature which lets you select which person you want to focus on in a group .
p7380
aVOn the dial it has four settings : Auto , Easy , Program and movie modes .
p7381
aVThe auto mode is just as with every other camera , the camera will select the settings it determines best , but you maintain control -LRB- if you care to select it -RRB- over the white balance and flash .
p7382
aVEasy is the same as auto , except no options .
p7383
aVProgram gives you the option to select among several `` scenes '' : Portrait , Landscape , Night , Kids  Pets , and Indoor -LRB- buried in the menu you can also select lesser used scene settings like Beach , Long Shutter , and Fireworks -RRB- .
p7384
aVThe only negative I 've encountered with the camera is the relatively slow processor .
p7385
aVThat is the power up time -LRB- the time between turning the camera on and taking the first picture -RRB- is average -LRB- about 2 seconds -RRB- , however , the time between pictures is around 2 seconds without the flash to 4 seconds with the flash .
p7386
aVIf you envision having -LRB- or wanting -RRB- to take faster pictures , then this is not the camera for you .
p7387
aVSimilarly , if you want to have any control over settings -LRB- i.e. shutter speed if you want to take pictures of your running toddler -RRB- this is not the camera for you .
p7388
aVBottom line : Canon replaces control and feature selection for extreme ease-of-use .
p7389
aVThis camera is a solid option for the money , and in case you are considering the A3000 IS , this -LRB- the A3100 -RRB- is well worth the extra $ 30 -LRB- better resolution and faster picture-to-picture time -RRB- .
p7390
aVThe picture quality is great , no blur and vivid colors .
p7391
aa(lp7392
VI liked this camera caz one of my friends has it .
p7393
aVThe picture quality is really good .
p7394
aVActually better than the slr i purchased .
p7395
aVpacking too was good .
p7396
aVIt was delivered on time .
p7397
aa(lp7398
VI bought this as an option to my Canon Rebel DSLR which I did n't use much due to its size .
p7399
aVI 've had the Pen E-PL1 for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased .
p7400
aVMy first purchase was the Panasonic 20mm f\u005c/1 .7 lens and it is a wonderful combination with the E-PL1 .
p7401
aVI can definitely see myself carrying this around much more than the DSLR its replacing .
p7402
aVThat 's where the value will be for me .
p7403
aVMy biggest complaint right now is the inability to find a VF-2 viewfinder .
p7404
aVThis would be extremely useful for me shooting with legacy manual focus lenses .
p7405
aVI highly recommend this for people who do n't need to carry around a big camera to feel like they are pros .
p7406
aVIf you are a pro this would probably work as a secondary camera to take when you do n't want to lug your big gear around .
p7407
aa(lp7408
VSo happy we selected the Minolta Maxxum HTsi camera , the instructions make it very easy to use and it is much lighter in weight than we expected .
p7409
aVCame on time for our first granddaughter Makenna .
p7410
aa(lp7411
VThis is my first DSLR camera .
p7412
aVI am sure there are already a lot of reviews out there pointing out how well this camera take pictures with little knowledge about DSLR which i completely agree .
p7413
aVGuide modes are also helpful to start right away taking pictures of flowing water , night portrait , moving objects , etc. .
p7414
aVOnce I have learned what kind of settings are needed , i change from guide mode to aperture or shutter priority mode .
p7415
aVPictures are nice and sharp per my standard .
p7416
aVI have taken couple of pictures with blur background effect and at low lights .
p7417
aVI am satisfied with the results .
p7418
aVOnly few things missing for me .
p7419
aVThey are : 1 -RRB- no wireless remote shutter release capability .
p7420
aV2 -RRB- no bracketing .
p7421
aVOverall , I would definitely recommend this DSLR .
p7422
aa(lp7423
VIt 's hard to believe that Celestron offers these binoculars at such a low price .
p7424
aVThis is my second pair from Celestron through Amazon , the first being 7 X 35 , also at a great price .
p7425
aVBased on the satisfaction of the 7 X 35 's , I purchased the 10 X 50 's to use with a binocular\u005c/mirror setup I have for amateur astronomy .
p7426
aVThe binoculars are easy to use , have a nice field of view , and lend themselves to a quick setup for my purposes .
p7427
aVIn my estimation , these binoculars work as well as some that are much more expensive .
p7428
aVAlthough there have been some negative comments about the quality of the product , I have not had that experience with either pair of binoculars I have purchased .
p7429
aVThey seem to be well made , and you ca n't beat the price .
p7430
aa(lp7431
Vso far so good with this camera .
p7432
aVhad a sony handy cam first .
p7433
aVdid n't care for picture quality .
p7434
aVgot this and looks and sounds much better on an hd tv .
p7435
aVstill figuring details on it but it is easy to get started .
p7436
aa(lp7437
VI got this thinking that it can be used during vacation but this is no good .
p7438
aVRight from the day I received this is has double vision .
p7439
aVDont waste your money .
p7440
aa(lp7441
VThis camera is diguised as a motion detector , however , the pinhole for the camera is a black dot on this white housing .
p7442
aVI guess most people would not be aware it is a camera , but somebody with a little knowledge would quickly suspect it is a camera due to the black dot on it .
p7443
aVOverall , the picture is OK  it has a nice field of view .
p7444
aVI feel the color is a little washed out but I was able to adjust the brightness  contrast in my DVR , making the picture a little better .
p7445
aVHowever , despite it 's shortcomings , I am definitely able to make out features  identify who is being caught on video .
p7446
aVSo I am satisfied overall with the camera .
p7447
aVAlso , there is no infrared\u005c/nightvision with this camera , but I knew this buying it .
p7448
aVI planned to use this camera to catch after hours theft from an office where the lighting may be dark .
p7449
aVIf the room has no light , you will see nothing .
p7450
aVHowever , it does very well in low-light .
p7451
aVFor my purposes , I leave one of the office computer monitors on screensaver with no timeout .
p7452
aVThis provides little light for a person to see , but the camera uses this light efectively .
p7453
aVActually , with just the monitor on with no other lights I find it hard to see with my eyes but the camera view is nice  bright .
p7454
aVSo it 's a good Low Lux camera .
p7455
aVI am thinking of just putting in a night light intead of the montor to provide that little bit of light the camera needs .
p7456
aVAlso , it looks new , so you may want to dirty it up or scuff it a bit to make it look like it 's been there for a long time to add to it 's covert feature .
p7457
aa(lp7458
VSony DSC-H5 is a great camera .
p7459
aVSpecially for the people who love long range optical zoom features like me .
p7460
aVIts 12X optical zoom lens is really really incredible .
p7461
aVWith minimum distorions , long distance photography with it is really an adventure .
p7462
aVOne of its great features is that , while shooting movies you can still use the zooming feature .
p7463
aVThis is quite handy since you can go upto 57X zoom in vga mode .
p7464
aVThe Super SteadyShot Optical Image Stabilization system is amazing .
p7465
aVI have taken a picture of the Moon on a full moon night with full 12X zoom and full manual controls without using a tripod , thanks to the Image Stabilization system .
p7466
aVThe large 3 inch LCD display is very useful .
p7467
aVIts easy to see all the details of a picture while shooting and while previewing also .
p7468
aVThe manual white balance adjustment works fine .
p7469
aVThe ` SET ' feature adjusts the white balance automatically according to your own background .
p7470
aVIn general , the camera offers great manual controls .
p7471
aVNow let me tell you why I gave the camera one less than a 5 star .
p7472
aV1 .
p7473
aVThe most lacking feature is an Accessory Shoe .
p7474
aVI am really suprised why ` Sony ' did not think of it .
p7475
aV2 .
p7476
aVAnother lacking feature is the `` RAW '' capture mode .
p7477
aVThis would have been very handy .
p7478
aV3 .
p7479
aVYou can not set the Image Quality at 6 MP or 4 MP .
p7480
aVIt has to be either 7 MP or 5 MP or less then 4 MP .
p7481
aVOptions for 6 MP and 4 MP would have helped as these are very common settings .
p7482
aVHowever , I do not know whether there is any technical limitation .
p7483
aV4 .
p7484
aVThe manual focus feature needs improvement , though using the Peaking feature helps a little .
p7485
aVIn conclusion the Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 7.2 MP Digital Camera is a great camera and I would surely recommend it to an amateur or a serious amateur or a hobbyist who can not afford a DSLR .
p7486
aa(lp7487
VPurchased because my original Digital 8 camcorder was on the fritz .
p7488
aVThis is a great replacement and I purchased it to transfer all of my existing Digital 8 tapes to disk as the format is being phased out .
p7489
aVAs it turned out , it was cheaper to purchase the new camcorder than to pay to have all tapes transferred .
p7490
aVNow if I will only get to them ... Image quality is good for Digital 8 .
p7491
aVIf you do not already have a library of Digital 8 tapes , I would explore one of Sony 's Mini DV , DVD or HDD camcorders instead .
p7492
aVIf you have a library of tapes , I would convert them to disk ASAP as the format is going away ...
p7493
aa(lp7494
VI have spent a great deal of time attempting to set up this camera .
p7495
aVThe software that it comes with is sad .
p7496
aVIt is put together poorly and is remanicent of 1990 's p.c. .
p7497
aV.
p7498
aVUnless you are great with wireless networks and you have a STATIC IP .
p7499
aVDO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA .
p7500
aVI got it from Amazon and was unable to get any support from them .
p7501
aVIn addition , Amazon told me to contact FOSCAM .
p7502
aVAfter waiting on the phone for over 30 min I was told that I needed to spend $ 150 on tech support .
p7503
aVNeedless to say , I returned the camera .
p7504
aa(lp7505
VA friend in Kansas City recently bought me the new Sony Bloggie Live camcorder , which allowed to me compare it to a Kodak Zi10 Play Touch which I replaced it with .
p7506
aVFirst , the money for the Bloggie Live is insane : $ 249.00 as compared to $ 129.99 at Best Buy , and for me it got sweeter when i bought the open box special for $ 80.99 .
p7507
aVYou simply can not beat that !
p7508
aVThe first time I used it , I knew instinctively that I did not like Sony 's entry ; I think that the requirement to take video horizontally was a deal breaker , as I want to be able to mount it on a tripod to do a weekly tv show , among other things .
p7509
aVIt also makes it very uncomfortable .
p7510
aVThe Kodak Play Touch not only can be used on a tripod , but you can use external condenser microphones , including wireless mics for talent , now that is totally cool , and you would have thought that a high priced camcorders like Bloggie Live would have come with that as standard feature , but no it did n't .
p7511
aVWhen I turned in the Bloggie Live , the portable battery , and the portable wi-fi hotspot to my Best Buy , I had over $ 400 of credit , when I used to by the Play Touch , a telephone , and tons of other stuff .
p7512
aVBloggie Live is way overpriced and hyped way too much by the manufacturer .
p7513
aVI think that the Koday Play Touch has 95 % of the features of the Bloggie Live , and some other features that it does not have .
p7514
aVI am giddy with having it , and even though I have a Flip camera as well , the Flip clearly does not compare .
p7515
aVI got the deal of a lifetime .
p7516
aVThis is a great camera , easy to use even for a 65 year old Senior like me , and takes great pics .
p7517
aVThe Bloggie Live actually smears photos and is notorious for not being able to cover fast moving events .
p7518
aVMan , I hated that thing , and if you use it to tape vertically , you got two huge Black bars on each side !
p7519
aVWhat the heck is that about ?
p7520
aVBad engineering and product design if you ask me .
p7521
aa(lp7522
VI purchased the S3 IS about a month ago after doing extensive research on digital cameras .
p7523
aVSince I 've had it , I ca n't seem to put it down !
p7524
aVPictures are sharp , the 12X zoom is amazing and the super macro function is unbelievable !
p7525
aVIf you do n't have the $ $ $ for a DSLR , this camera is the one to get ...
p7526
aa(lp7527
VI dont have much to say here because I dont know that much about DSLR .
p7528
aVThe reason I got one is I wanted to upgrade from point and shoots and I can never be more satisfied .
p7529
aVThe pictures were great and I feel like a pro .
p7530
aVI cant believe how small it is though and it 's very light to carry .
p7531
aVI just love my Nikon D3000 .
p7532
aVThank you for making this affordable .
p7533
aVIt was such a great deal especially for first-time DSLR user like me .
p7534
aa(lp7535
VCould not be more pleased and excited to own this digital camera .
p7536
aVFor the features and quality of the DSC H-5 you could not make a better investment or get anything better for your money .
p7537
aVAlthough the DSC H-5 is not a compact digital camera that can be put in your pocket , I do not find the camera to be bulky at all and find it quite easy to handle Taking pictures with this camera takes digital photography for non professionals to a higher level .
p7538
aVMacro images are unbelievable with this camera .
p7539
aVThe 3 '' display is just awesome .
p7540
aVProtect your investment , would recommend a `` High '' quality screen protector .
p7541
aVFound one online for $ 20 that has a lifetime guarantee and does not peel or lift on the edges .
p7542
aVI did however purchase a better quality adapter ring to replace the plastic one that came with the camera since I use additional lenses and filters .
p7543
aVIncredible camera , you will not be disappointed .
p7544
aa(lp7545
VI 'll say it again - this is a great camera , considering the price .
p7546
aVThe video quality far surpasses VHS-C , for a VHS-C price .
p7547

p7566
aVThe lousiest setting that you can every run into .

p7568
aVCan not zoom while recording in video mode .
p7569
aVI am just thinking if I should purchase Canon 870 IS .

aa(lp7580
VWell , it has been a year since I recieved my Rebel XT and I am more than pleased with the camera .
p7581
aVThe build quality , features , and photo quality have made this camera a joy to own and use .
p7582
aVWhen I first decided to move from film to digital , I began the long and tedious process of researching all the cameras on the market at the time .
p7583
aVI had previously owned many Canon film cameras and compact digital cameras , so they were of course my first choice .
p7584
aVI looked at Nikon , Olympus , Canon , and Konica -LRB- now Sony -RRB- dSLR 's .
p7585
aVThe Canon came out on top in all catergories with the exception of a few at the time , such as price because of the Nikon D50 , though the Rebel 's other features clearly outway the Nikon .
p7586
aVOverall , the Canon is just a superior camera , so hopefully , that saves you the trouble of spending nearly a month researching .
p7587
aVAlright , so how is that camera ?
p7588
aVIt is wonderful .
p7589
aVIt fits well in my hands and everything is where it should be .
p7590
aVIt does feel a little light , but it is made to be compact and light , plus that can easily be remidied by adding a battery grip .
p7591
aVAll of it 's settings and features are virtually identical to the more expensive 20D , as is the image quality .
p7592
aVThere is a good amount of grain at ISO 1600 , which is really a shame , but that can generally be fixed in an image editing program or by using a flash .
p7593
aVThe battery life is very good , but I do reccomend purchasing that battery grip that I mentioned before .
p7594
aVNot only does it add weight and balance the camera , but it also doubles the battery life , which is good for those of us who go out and take thousands of pictures .
p7595
aVThis is just a wonderful camera for the prosumer crowd , and there is no reason that it can not be used as a pro camera for creating prints and such .
p7596
aVI would recomend this to anyone looking to break into photography or someone who has been photographing for 30 years .
p7597
aVMy recomendations : - Get a few extra batteries and a battery grip .
p7598
aVRemember , you do n't have to buy a Canon grip or batteries , and if you do n't , you 'll probably save at least 50 % .
p7599
aVDo some research on here .
p7600
aVThe Opteka grip is great , it is what I own , and you can find a huge number of batteries , just pick own with a good review .
p7601
aV- Sigma lenses are generally in expensive , take great shots , and are durable .
p7602
aVSome Canon lenses will have better optics , but will cost at least twice as much .
p7603
aV- Get the Canon 50mm f\u005c/1 .8 .
p7604
aVIt is a very inexpensive lens -LRB- about $ 60 - $ 70 -RRB- and takes amazing shots .
p7605
aV- Big memory cards are amazing .
p7606
aVBuy one , seriously .
p7607
aVI have a 6GB card and shoot in RAW , so I get about 650 pictures .
p7608
aVJPG will get 2000 .
p7609
aVI need another one because I shoot so much .
p7610
aV- External hard drives are a must for all those big files .
p7611
aVI have a 250GB Phantom Drive , and I reccomend that , but there are now many cheaper alternatives .
p7612
aV- Do n't forget a tripod and\u005c/or a monopod , a flash -LRB- though it does have one , external flashes are much better -RRB- , and filters if you want to experiment .
p7613
aVHope you enjoy your camera as much as I have !

VI have been an ardent user of Canon products for 15 years , purchasing over 18 cameras , camcorders , and lenses .
p7630
aVI use the cameras to photograph and film projects for marketing our company 's products .
p7631
aVIn other words I have always relied on Canon 's quality to support my job function .
p7632
aVNext week I have a 4-day project in another state that requires low light filming that my HV20 is not good at .
p7633
aVMaybe now is the time for me to move up to a more professional camcorder , such as a XA10 .
p7634
aVAfter studying reviews I realized that there is a rattle problem with the handle .
p7635
aVI called Canon Technical Support to see if the problem had been resolved and was told that it only occurred if the camcorder was shaken or that I could tape the switches .
p7636
aVMy reasoning is , why would I want to purchase a camera with a known quality issue for $ 2,200 and then have to apply tape for it to function properly .
p7637
aVThe technician agreed that if this was my feeling , I might want to consider the HFG10 as a low light alternative .
p7638
aVAgain I researched the reviews and ordered the HFG10 from Amazon .
p7639
aVIt was delivered Jan12th .
p7640
aVImagine my frustration when after three days of setting up the HFG10 , purchasing additional accessories such as , additional batteries , filters , power packs and 32GB memory cards , I found a fault with the memory card slot .
p7641
aVIt will not hold in and secure the memory card .
p7642
aVI called Canon technical support and was told by both a support technician and a supervisor that I could send it back to them for repair .
p7643
aVREPAIR , I have not used it yet , it has only been out of the box 5 times .
p7644
aV`` Well that is our policy '' said the officious Canon supervisor , or you could send it back to Amazon for a replacement or refund .
p7645
aVConclusion : Obviously Canon has quality control , design and function issues and no concern for their loyal purchasers .
p7646
aVAlso , it seems they have little environmental concern for carbon footprint .
p7647
aVScenario 1 : I ship the HFG10 back to Amazon for an exchange , Amazon ship a replacement back to me .
p7648
aVAmazon now ships the original camera back to Canon .
p7649
aVScenario 2 : It 's called customer loyalty or we stand by our brand !
p7650
aVI ship their HFG10 back to Canon ; they exchange it and tighten their href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HW7DZM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-0421392-5862146"> Canon VIXIA HF G10 Full HD Camcorder with HD CMOS Pro and 32GB Internal Flash Memory  Scenario 3 : In frustration of poor customer service by Canon , I send the HFG10 back to Amazon for a full refund and never purchase another Canon product .
p7651
aVIn today 's financial climate , we the customers are looking to purchase quality products at a reasonable price and have that company support their brand and their loyal customers .

VThere are already extensive and excellent reviews of this camera on the site .
p7654
aVI just wanted to add a few thoughts from the perspective of someone who is not a pro but has been a serious hobbyist .
p7655
aVI 've owned the D50 and D90 and this one blows them away .
p7656
aVThe primary thing that I am impressed with is the Scene Mode shooting .
p7657
aVI have previously been someone who might fiddle around with adjusting EV to get a more saturated picture , or even tried to fiddle with white balance a time or two .
p7658
aVI often wound up shooting in P mode because I could make and keep my own adjustments .
p7659
aVThis camera out-thinks me on every shot .
p7660
aVShoot a landscape without putting it in landscape mode and it 's fine .
p7661
aVDial up Landscape on the Scene dial and it 's more saturated with more dense colors -- just a better looking shot .
p7662
aVShoot indoors without a flash and into a room with at least 3 different types of lighting -- halogens , incandescents , floods -- and it perfectly balances the different light types -- you can even see one light is slightly orange , another very white -- and you still get great flesh tones .
p7663
aVI think my days of fiddling are over .
p7664
aVThe scene modes think and work better than I do .
p7665
aVI love this thing .
p7666
aVIt lets me get back to concentrating on the shot and making as good pictures as I can , rather than fiddling with technicalities .
p7667
aVGreat work , Nikon .
p7668
aa(lp7669
VThis is a phenomenal camera .
p7670
aVThe display is large and clear crystal .
p7671
aVThe resolution very good -LRB- I do n't want larger resolutions for what I want to print -RRB- .
p7672
aVIt has a fast focus , and gets great color .
p7673
aVI definitely recommend it to anybody .
p7674
aVThe camera 's features are equivalent to Sony 's T30 , but I like the look and feel of Canon better ... it feels much better in your hands than what looks in the pictures .
p7675
aa(lp7676
VFirst day i got the glasses they worked fine , after about a week i decided to try them out on my xbox -LRB- military barracks , no room for a TV -RRB- they worked fine at first , then the picture turned off , and from then on they were only about as useful as playing a video game with a high tech pair of headphones .
p7677
aVIt sucks that i pay $ 250 for a product and cant expect it to work as advertised
p7678
aa(lp7679
VI 've never owned a set of binoculars , so I do n't have any direct basis for comparison .
p7680
aVHowever , I 'm a bit of an astronomy buff and can tell you that the quality of the optics in these binoculars is right up there with my more impressive telescope eyepieces .
p7681
aVMy toddler dropped them on concrete and the soft rubber encasing the optics absorbed the shock with no problem , so my impression thus far is that they are pretty durable .
p7682
aVYou 'll need a tripod for extended use since they 're a little heavy .

VI purchased this camera in December 2010 and have been using it for about a month .
p7685
aVIt has many features , so I am still learning about all the things that it can do .
p7686
aVI did n't give this camera 5 stars because I am not certain if everything is functioning properly .
p7687
aVThe autofocus is either not consistently working or I just do n't understand how to use it consistently .
p7688
aVMany of the pictures that I think are in focus are not in focus when I open them .
p7689
aVThe pictures that actually turn out are very good quality and exceed my expectations .
p7690
aVThe manual is laid out nicely ; once you learn how to do something , like set the timer , turn off the flash , etc. it is easy .
p7691
aVThough I think it may be time to purchase an addition reference guide to help learn how to use more of the camera 's features .
p7692
aVIf it turns out that I just need to gain a better understanding of how to use the autofocus , I would give this camera 5 stars .

VThe Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 is a very capable camera with a high quality wide angle to 12X zoom lens .
p7695
aVIt has excellent features and numerous fun and useful mode settings .
p7696
aVThe pinhole and the film grain effects are two of my favorites .
p7697
aVIt should be noted that these special effects can also be applied to the full HD video also .
p7698
aVThe video recording utilizes full time auto focus and you have full use of the cameras optical zoom , this with the great image stabilizer makes for excellent video quality .
p7699
aVThere is a full range of manual settings on this camera as well , however , for some reason they did not include manual focus .
p7700
aVFor the person who is not all that up on how to make custom camera settings\u005c/adjustments , the Intelligent Auto setting makes using this camera a breeze ... There are some quite advanced capabilities in this mode that are beyond the scope of this review to expound upon .
p7701
aVlet it suffice to say that it really does an excellent job of analyzing the environment you are taking the picture in and making the appropriate setting adjustments so your pictures turn out looking great .
p7702
aVThe built in GPS is useful for tagging the location of your picture for future reference .
p7703
aVThe only real negative issue I have with this camera is the small size of the image sensor .
p7704
aVAs with many cameras in this category , the small sensor does not lend itself to the best low light photography .
p7705
aVIn low light situations , you will notice some digital noise in the picture .
p7706
aVHowever , in normal light this camera has excellent photo quality .
p7707
aVI have been using this camera for a couple months now when I do n't want to lug around my other equipment .

VCute little camera for my daughter .
p7713
aVShe loves the ease and size .
p7714
aVThe shipping was fast .
p7715
aVIt is easy to carry around because it 's so small .
p7716
aVMakes taking pictures fun and convenient .
p7717
aa(lp7718
VThis is a really cool camera !!
p7719
aVIt is my first camera and I wanted something that would allow me to be creative and introduce me to a more professional level of photography .
p7720
aVThere are so many features on this camera that it is not for someone who just wants the basics .
p7721
aVGet ready to have a wide range of options .
p7722
aVThere is so much here that they could n't even fit the full instruction booklet in the box .
p7723
aVI love that it takes standard AA batteries and allows you to record movies in HD .
p7724
aVYou can attach a tripod to this and an additional flash if you want , right now I do n't need them but nice to know I have the option .
p7725
aVIt is well made and SO fun to use , I feel like a kid in a candy store .
p7726
aVI did research for about a week to find exactly what I wanted : quality , top-rated brand , tons of features , decent price , and not too big .
p7727
aVIf you do n't want to spend upwards of $ 500 on a camera but want comething professional , this is IT !!
p7728
aVP.S. .
p7729
aVSo far my favorite feature is the Color Accent part , it allows you to take the most unique and gorgeous pictures !
p7730
aa(lp7731
VThe wide angle -LRB- 28 mm equiv -RRB- is beautiful -- much closer to the range your eye sees normally than the usual 35 mm equivalent .
p7732
aVI 'd read that the lens loses sharpness around the edges at its widest setting -- but if the loss is measurable , it is not noticeable .
p7733
aVDo n't worry about it .
p7734
aVThe camera feels good in the hand , with enough heft to feel substantial , not toy-like .
p7735
aVThe image stabilization works .
p7736
aVI took a hand-held macro close-up of a bee hovering over a flower in less-than-bright light , and it came out sharp sharp , like with a tripod - all the little hairs on the bee 's legs .
p7737
aVGenerally , though , brace the camera as best you can when shooting in low light .
p7738
aVThe image stabilization is very helpful , but it is not absolute .
p7739
aVHaving lots of extra pixels is useless if you just print whole pictures at smaller than poster-size .
p7740
aV3.2 megapixels is plenty for that .
p7741
aVBut if you like to crop to a tiny piece of the whole picture and blow it up to a regular size , the extra pixels let you do it -- the more you have , the tinier piece of the whole will be usable as your final picture .
p7742
aVThe 7.1 megapixels this camera has is excellant for the purpose -- but I would not scoff at having more .
p7743
aVAt some point , the quality of the lens becomes the limitation .
p7744
aVThe reviews say the 1600 ISO is too noisy to be useful .
p7745
aVIt is noisy -- but it lets you get a picture where you could get nothing at all without it .
p7746
aVI closed myself into a totally dark room and tried it -LRB- without flash , of course -RRB- -- not surprisingly , I got nothing but black .
p7747
aVThen I opened the door a tiny bit , letting in only enough light to begin to see some shapes without detail .
p7748
aVAt 1600 ISO , that 's exactly what the picture showed .
p7749
aVIf you can see it at all with your eyes , you can get the picture .
p7750
aVThe picture will have about the same amount of detail you can see with your eyes .
p7751
aVThis is not a night-vision spy-camera , but it is terrific for recording whatever you can see .
p7752
aVThe green power-light is annoying for night shooting -- too bright .
p7753
aa(lp7754
VI just bought this canon powershot A2200 yesterday .
p7755
aVI love the functions , the easy to use buttons .
p7756
aVI can not wait till tomorrow to go and take pictures .
p7757
aVI love the size of the camera and needed a small camera besides my Nikon D50 which is sometimes awkward .
p7758
aVI returned the Kodak camera and decided to try Canon !!
p7759
aVI had a canon many years ago and remember how sharp the pictures were !!
p7760
aa(lp7761
VWhen I went searching for a digital camera , I was looking for something inexpensive with at least 3 megapixels -LRB- which is enough for simple pictures and website publishing -RRB- and the ability to transfer pictures easily in multiple ways .
p7762
aVI never imagined I could get that for $ 100 .
p7763
aVI have been very satisfied with the Kodak CX7300 and would recommend it highly .
p7764
aVBut since you are getting it for such a steal , you should also invest in some accessories to make your life easier .
p7765
aVA cable and software are included with the camera , so you can download pictures easily by pressing the one-touch `` share '' button -LRB- once you have the software loaded on your computer -RRB- .
p7766
aVBut you basically have to download all of your pictures at once and you are using up your batteries somewhat as you do that .
p7767
aVKodak also makes docking stations that work with all their cameras , but I wanted to get something that could work with other electronic devices as well .
p7768
aVSo I also purchased SanDisk ImageMate 5 in 1 Reader -LRB- under $ 20 -RRB- and a Viking 512 MB Secure Digital Flash Card -LRB- under $ 50 from Amazon -RRB- -- which is less than most docking stations .
p7769
aVThe storage capacity on the CX7300 alone is very minimal -LRB- 16MB -RRB- , so you will definitely want to pick up some type of flash memory card .
p7770
aV512 MB may be more than you need to buy , but it sure makes your life easier .
p7771
aVI actually still have not filled up the card and I 've been taking lots of pictures for over a month now .
p7772
aVThe SanDisk device makes transferring pictures to any computer easy , since it is just like using an external disk drive that plugs into a USB port .
p7773
aVThe combination of the two helps conserve batteries -LRB- I still have not changed them -RRB- and is very easy to figure out .
p7774
aVI never read a manual on any of this -LRB- including the camera , which is very user-friendly -RRB- , and I would n't call myself a `` tech guru '' by any means .
p7775
aVOne small reservation about the camera 's design : the on-switch is a turning wheel on top of the camera and so it can easily turn itself on as you slip it into a pocket or backpack and it rubs against a surface that turns the wheel .
p7776
aVI 've often found my camera in the `` on '' position as I took it out .
p7777
aVBut this does not seem to have done anything obvious to my battery life , so there may be a sort of sleep mode if it is left on for a long period -LRB- I have n't investigated this fully -RRB- .
p7778
aVI 'd also recommend you pick up some lithium batteries .
p7779
aVFriends recommended rechargable batteries , but I ca n't be bothered and the initial cost is discouraging .
p7780
aVI find I 'm getting lots of battery life .
p7781
aa(lp7782
VI have been using this camera for several years now .
p7783
aVI bought it when the 20D was the newest offering in the Canon line .
p7784
aVI paid big bucks for the camera plus the lens , about $ 1400 at the time .
p7785
aVIt is a shock to find out that this expensive machine is now only worth about maybe $ 300 , used .
p7786
aVI have gotten a lot of good use out of it , however .
p7787
aVMy photography skills have improved with the availability of the custom features that this camera offers .
p7788
aVWhile it has a good selection of point-and-shoot options , I have not been using them .
p7789
aVThey work quite well , but so do the selections for manual settings , and when used correctly , these manual settings make for creative photography .
p7790
aVI recently bought a large format printer , and I have been blowing up photos shot from this camera to 11 '' x 17 '' images .
p7791
aVI had shot the photos from a tripod , and the details even at that extreme size are sharp and vivid .
p7792
aVThe 17 to 85 mm IS lens that I bought with the camera has turned out to be versatile and useful .
p7793
aVIt is able to take moderate macro photos , and its wide angle feature is something that a lot of camera buyers would not specifically look for , but when you have it , it is wonderful to take wide pictures outdoors .
p7794
aVIf I could change the camera , there are two things that bug me : one is that the viewfinder is not 100 % of what comes through the lens , so that if you focus tightly on a subject , when you see the image on your computer there is extra real estate around the edges that you did not plan to put in the picture .
p7795
aVThe other problem is the LCD screen in the back .
p7796
aVIf you are shooting outdoors , it is very nearly impossible to see what you have on the LCD screen .
p7797
aVI guess it just is n't bright enough .
p7798
aVNeither of these problems are bad enough for me to take a star off my rating .
p7799
aVOn the plus side , this camera takes very good pictures in low light situations .
p7800
aVWhile there is , in fact , some noise at ISO 1600 , it is not enough to ruin the photo the way it does on so many other cameras .
p7801
aVIt is great for taking pictures in theaters with the lights low without a flash .
p7802
aVThe flash itself is powerful , and if you like using a flash , then this is a good one .
p7803
aVOne of the features that I most appreciate is the ability for the camera to shoot in RAW mode .
p7804
aVWhen I first got the camera , I shot JPEG 's .
p7805
aVHowever , as I became more familiar with the RAW feature , I began to appreciate it more .
p7806
aVAlso , over the years , Adobe has greatly improved its camera RAW application .
p7807
aVNow I would not dream of shooting anything other than RAW , because of the ability to adjust your picture before converting it to a JPEG or TIFF .
p7808
aVIn Adobe camera RAW , you can open your picture in either 8-bit mode or 16 bit mode , and you can also open it in either a small or huge size and several sizes in between .
p7809
aVI consider this to be a great advantage .
p7810
aVIf you are new to photography , or on a tight budget , I would highly recommend this camera .
p7811
aVEven though it is now several models back from Canon 's newest top-of-the-line , it still takes fine pictures and has many options for customizing your shooting .
p7812
aa(lp7813
VMy gift to myself ... a nikon S570 ... a portable camera that would take great pics ... so they said ... all those Aston Kucher commercials , etc. ... some pics are great - outdoors ... it seems that after 5pm , my pics blur badly , they lack sharpness .
p7814
aVI have played with the ISO setting , I have tried different settings on the pre-programed options .
p7815
aVI have found that I need to use the snow\u005c/beach day setting in the evening hours to get a NOT - sharp pic ... and I have found that when I just stick my arm out and click , I have a better chance of getting a decent photograph than if I take the time to aim , focus and shoot !
p7816
aVAnd ... the zoom is horrible and I think I have a steady hand ... what good is a zoom that I can not utilize ??
p7817
aVI shoot the pic at the non-zoom setting , then , in photo review , zoom in on the chosen photo and crop out what I was actually aiming for .
p7818
aVI used this camera on a trip to Turkey and shot about 10000 pics while there .
p7819
aVI tried many ways to fix my problem - even spoke to two photo shop workers who gave good advice , but it did not give me what I needed .
p7820
aVI joked that I needed to take 100 pics to get one good one !
p7821
aVSo my Cool Pix are not very COOL !
p7822
aVI am shopping now for a Canon , which I have had success with for years prior to my CoolPix .
p7823
aVmy regular digital is the SLR type , so maybe I am expecting too much of Nikon 's S570 ... but for the price I paid , I feel it should have performed much better .
p7824
aa(lp7825
VI got these for my dad for Christmas and he loves them .
p7826
aVHe was planning to just use them as a backup pair but once he got them he decided to use them as his main pair , because they are great binoculars -LRB- and no , I do n't think he was just saying that .
p7827
aVLOL .
p7828
aVHe had a gushing enthusiasm you just ca n't fake ! -RRB-
p7829
aa(lp7830
Vgreat little camera however the seal on the door to the battery\u005c/SD card could be tighter , it always lets water in all around the lip and seal , so you must quickly dry it off or it run 's into the chamber with the battery in it ?
p7831
aVi sent the first one back because of this and the next one had identical problem .
p7832
aVi guess i should be asking if this is normal ?
p7833
aa(lp7834
VThis camera is very pocketable and takes good pictures most of the time - exactly what I was looking for , for a `` social '' camera .
p7835
aVOnly major complaint is the camera majorly underexposes shots in outdoor lighting about 20-30 % of the time .
p7836
aVWhen taking a picture , the preview screen looks correctly exposed , but then when the shutter is half-pressed the camera focuses and the preview goes very dark .
p7837
aVHappens in `` P '' and `` Auto '' modes .
p7838
aVI 've only used the camera for a couple of weeks , and hopefully I can work around this by adjusting the E\u005c/V compensation , but for a point-and-shoot I should n't have to .
p7839
aVExpected better from Canon .
p7840
aa(lp7841
VThis is a combined Sony DSC-H55 and Panasonic DMC-ZS5 review .
p7842
aVMy wife first bought the Sony and was happy until she shot some video .
p7843
aVWe next tried the Panasonic .
p7844
aVThey both are very close in the photo results .
p7845
aVIn normal light and 1 to 3X focal length , they are for the most part equal with Sony having the edge .
p7846
aVAt max telephoto the sharper lens of the Panasonic makes itself known .
p7847
aVIn poor light the Sony is very soft and the Panasonic is sharper but noisier .
p7848
aVIf you do n't use either camera for video they are quite close .
p7849
aVNow video is another matter .
p7850
aVHere it is straight from the properties from a clip from each camera .
p7851
aVThe Sony records at 1280x720 data rate 9,148 29 frames\u005c/second .
p7852
aVThe Panasonic records at 1280x720 data rate 31,168 30 frames\u005c/second .
p7853
aVSony uses MP4 and Panasonic uses MOV .
p7854
aVSony 's video is good only for video sharing , moving video to MP4 devices and the like , a lot of pixilation .
p7855
aVShown on a large 16x9 LCD display it is worse than a good SD video .
p7856
aVWe did not look at the Canon because they lock out the zoom when shooting video .
p7857
aVThe Panasonic focus while zooming is quite good .
p7858
aVThere is some zoom noise but it is low .
p7859
aVI would recommend a bridge camera if you can get by with the larger size and greater cost as the P\u005c/S large telephoto lens\u005c/sensor are just too much of a compromise .
p7860
aVIn summary , Sony photo 3.6 stars and Panasonic 3.5 stars .
p7861
aVSony video 1 star and Panasonic video 4 stars .
p7862
aVBest P\u005c/S I 've seen is the Canon SD780 IS 3X telephoto .
p7863
aVBecause we had this camera to compare to , the Sony and Panasonic got low marks in sharpness and noise .
p7864
aVUpdate 8-2-2010 : I removed the camera from i\u005c/A mode and set the ISO not to go over ISO 200 .
p7865
aVWe are now getting much better photos .
p7866
aVThe Panasonic I\u005c/A mode moved the ISO up too quick .
p7867
aVAfter a couple of hundred photos , I now give this camera 4.5 stars .
p7868
aa(lp7869
VI may have missed this answer in someone 's review , but could someone tell me if this camera comes with cables to connect to a dvd recorder and\u005c/or vcr -LRB- yes , vcr -RRB- for copying ?
p7870
aa(lp7871
VI gave this item as a gift and the recipient was thrilled !!!
p7872
aa(lp7873
VWhile the DVS20 does n't provide high-quality video , it 's very adequate , especially considering the price .
p7874
aVI am a college tennis player and use it to tape my tennis matches .
p7875
aVThe quality is just fine .
p7876
aVThe DVS20 takes decent pictures as well .
p7877
aVI 'm happy with this product and would recommend it to those who do n't need serious , high-quality video .
p7878
aa(lp7879
VCamera arrived as promised -LRB- 2 day Prime -RRB- .
p7880
aVCamera was easy to use and we began taking pictures immediately .
p7881
aVThe pictures are sharp and detailed and there is a lot that you can do with it .
p7882
aVWe will need to spend time reading the manual to learn about some of the more advanced features .
p7883
aVWe are delighted with our purchase .
p7884
aa(lp7885
VWhen reading this review , keep in mind that I 'm not a technophile when it comes to cameras , do n't know all that much about the jargon , etc. .
p7886
aVI 'm also not a person who has any interest in SLRs or fiddling with manual settings or who cares about RAW .
p7887
aVFrom what I 've read of other reviews , if you fall into these categories , especially the need for RAW , this camera may not be you .
p7888
aVBut for me personally , this is the single best camera I 've ever owned , and my first Canon after years of Sony Cybershot point and shoots .
p7889
aVI chose this camera for a two month stay in Japan after doing weeks and weeks of research on different cameras and weighing the pros and cons of each , so here are my own pros and cons after about two months of working with this camera -LRB- still in Japan by the way as of this review : -RRB- Pros : 1 .
p7890
aVThe 35x optical zoom is absolutely divine .
p7891
aVSuperior ability to retain focus and so good , you can practically double the SX40 as binoculars .
p7892
aVIt 's that amazing .
p7893
aVFor someone who had an excellent zoom as his # 1A priority in getting a camera -LRB- # 1 was image quality -RRB- , I could not be happier with this feature .
p7894
aVEven my friends who are following my photoblog of Japan on Facebook have commented that the various different zoom pictures I 've posted has made them want this camera .
p7895
aV2 .
p7896
aVTerrific image quality , even in outdoor pictures .
p7897
aVI say that because traditionally from my own experience and those of friends\u005c/family members , Sony tends to have better outdoor picture cameras and Canon tends to be much better indoors\u005c/low-lighting .
p7898
aVThis camera excels even the best Sony cameras I 've had at outdoor pictures , which impresses the heck out of me .
p7899
aVIndoor\u005c/low-light image quality , is , of course , still miles ahead of anyone else .
p7900
aV3 .
p7901
aVAs far as I can tell , the battery life is quite good on these .
p7902
aVI 'd still have a spare battery with you just in case , but they seem to hold up really well .
p7903
aV4 .
p7904
aVThe image stabilization is fantastic , just fantastic .
p7905
aVEven when my hands are shaky as all get out , the SX40 does a superb job of correcting for that deficiency , more so than any other camera I 've ever used .
p7906
aVCons : 1 .
p7907
aVThe only drawback that bothers me is every once in a great while -LRB- like say , maybe once every 700 or so pictures -RRB- , there will be what look to be dust specks on a picture .
p7908
aVI think someone else reported something similar on another review , only for them it happened a lot more frequently than with mine .
p7909
aVHopefully that low occurrence rate holds up .
p7910
aV2 .
p7911
aVIf you 're looking for something you can just put in your pocket and go .
p7912
aV.
p7913
aVwell no , that 's not going to work .
p7914
aVYou 're going to need to carry this in a camera bag that it 'll fit in .
p7915
aVFortunately I have a bag it fits in that is n't much trouble at all to haul around , but I still got a cheap backup compact point and shoot -LRB- the Sony DSC-W690 , which I 've written a review for as well -RRB- .
p7916
aVOverall Verdict : I love this camera , and while I like to change\u005c/upgrade cameras every few years , this is so far and away the best , most easy to use , most enjoyable camera I 've ever had , that it will be a very long time before I look to replace it .
p7917
aVIts stellar zoom , image quality , and ease of use all make it the perfect camera for my own personal needs and desires , and at a price that wo n't break the bank or require advanced understanding of manual features like an SLR .
p7918
aa(lp7919
VI bought this camera December 2010 and it just stopped working this month -LRB- Nov 2011 -RRB- .
p7920
aVPicture quality was great but now I have to buy a new camera or try to get it repaired .
p7921
aVVery disappointing , there was no reason for the camera to stop working , no damage .
p7922
aVObviously will not buy again because call me crazy , but I feel a camera should last longer than 11 months .
p7923
aa(lp7924
VAwesome !!!
p7925
aVGreat product with low price !!!
p7926
aVDelivered in the right time and in perfect conditions .
p7927
aVEasy to learn the features and explore the potential .
p7928
aVI highly recommend it !!!
p7929
aa(lp7930
VIt was an easy assemble process and I have used it during the day and it works just fine but for some reason -LRB- manufacture error or my own -RRB- at night you cant see a thing weither the sky is totally clear or not .
p7931
aVSince the sole purpose of purchasing this product was to look at stars and planets I consider this a waste of money ...
p7932
aa(lp7933
VPerhaps Sony made this camera specifically for Prince .
p7934
aVI 'm not sure who else would enjoy having all this purple added to nearly every single picture .
p7935
aVIt 's terrible that for 1000 bucks , you have ot put up with this shoddy performance .
p7936
aVFolks , 8 megapixels do n't mean a darned thing when the implementation is this horrible .
p7937
aVI returned mine and I used the money on a Digital Rebel and a Sigma 75-300 mm lens for the same price .
p7938
aVI get much better pictures , and I can use the lenses I buy on future cameras I buy .
p7939
aVGood riddance , Sony .
p7940
aVNow apparently your cameras are as bad as your customer support has always been .
p7941
aa(lp7942
VWe are beyond satisfied with the purchase .
p7943
aVThe camera works great and we love having a smaller camera for vacations .
p7944
aVVery pleased !
p7945
aa(lp7946
VI wish we had read all the reviews before we purchased our JVC piece of junk .
p7947
aVAfter a few short hours we too got an error message about condensation .
p7948
aVThere is no condensation problem .
p7949
aVThe problem is that JVC made a defective product and could care less .
p7950
aa(lp7951
VThis camera is a great value !
p7952
aVIt was cheaper than any of my local electronics stores .
p7953
aVVery user friendly !
p7954
aVExtremely happy with this camcorder .
p7955
aVJust now working on making DVDs of the videos I have taken and its has an easy burn which I have not used yet .
p7956
aVI am using Windows Movie Maker because I wanted to edit and create and the format the videos download onto computer works great with WMM .
p7957
aVNo complaints on this camcorder !
p7958
aVI know there is an updated version of this but I 'm not sure I would even bother spending the extra $ $ to get it .
p7959
aVThis camcorder is great !
p7960
aVIt also switches between video and photos effortlessly !
p7961
aVGreat Buy !
p7962
aa(lp7963
VThis little camera records great , especially during daylight conditions .
p7964
aVIt 's very user friendly and the touch screen is pretty neat as well .
p7965
aVWell priced .
p7966
aa(lp7967
VI got this less than a day ago , so my use has n't been exhaustive , but so far I 'm impressed .
p7968
aVWhen I read the camera took AA batteries , I assumed they would n't be included , especially since I bought a refurb camera .
p7969
aVMy camera came with not only four rechargable AA batteries , but a charger for them .
p7970
aVThe zoom on this thing is AMAZING .
p7971
aVI was able to get some decent surface detail on the moon without any external assistance .
p7972
aVOn manual shutter speed control you can only go up to 16 seconds , which is a definite downgrade from my old camera 's max of 64 seconds .
p7973
aVHowever , this one will allow an ISO of up to 1600 vs. the old camera 's 400 , so it 's kind of a wash .
p7974
aVMy old 2 gig SD card will definitely not be big enough for this thing - 4 meg JPEGs or 25 meg KDC raws will fill it up fast .
p7975
aVThe 64 megs of internal memory is a joke , but trying to use a modern camera without an SD card is a joke anyway .
p7976
aVThe vertical shutter button is novel , but I 'm used to not having one so I doubt I 'll make much use of it .
p7977
aVOne annoyance is that you have to open the battery door to remove the SD card , which cuts power to the camera .
p7978
aVMore thorough review when I 've had time to properly put this thing through its paces , but I like it so far .

VBoth camera companies have five letters in their titles , however , only one company has a Wow !
p7981
aV-- Nikon .
p7982
aVI purchased a Canon PowerShot two years ago and thought that I was royalty .
p7983
aVWell , that was then ; this is now .
p7984
aVWith the Nikon D3000 , I am king of the world .
p7985
aVMy brother gave me the Nikon D3000 for Christmas .
p7986
aVIt 's virtually impossible to take a bad photo with the Nikon D3000 .
p7987
aVI am impressed with the Retouch features that will make a photo brighter , take out any red eye , do a color balance to your perfection -LRB- remember , the purple color of a lilac is just about impossible to capture but you can get that defined color with the color balance feature on the Nikon D3000 -RRB- , or trim a photo to take out any unwanted scenery or subjects .
p7988
aVI took photos of my Christmas tree at night and the pictures are spectacular and the multi-color lights cast their hues to their true colors .
p7989
aVSure , there is the competition that gives you 19 scene modes , but really , the only two you need are Auto and Auto no flash .
p7990
aVIf you are at a fireworks display or at an aquarium , the auto no flash is all you need .
p7991
aVWho wants a movie mode with a camera ?
p7992
aVI have a Sony HD camcorder that takes 1080P movies and I know there is no camera on the market that can take superior movies like the HD camcorder .
p7993
aVWhen cameras supply a movie mode , something in relation to picture quality is going to be sacrificed .
p7994
aVWho needs Live View ?
p7995
aVWhen you are outside in the bright sun , you ca n't see the image on the LCD screen while shooting .
p7996
aVPeople pay for gingerbread ... I want a great camera , instead .
p7997
aVThis Nikon D3000 is the best camera I have ever owned .
p7998
aVThis camera is so good that the President would consider hiring me to be his personal photographer .
p7999

VAfter using the GH2 for a few days , I have found it a rather fascinating camera .
p8001
aVI 'm a videographer and mainly want to use it for video .
p8002
aVThe low light abilities of the camera are fantastic and the ability to select 24p is an instant hit .
p8003
aVWhen it comes to photos , there are so many options on the GH2 I just ca n't decide what to use .
p8004
aVI 've reserved myself to forums for preferred settings because there is just so much to choose from !
p8005
aVI was given a couple of old lens from my grandfather before he died and with a small 4\u005c/3 adapter , I could use them to take some fantastic pictures .
p8006
aVI wish he was here to see it as he was an avid photographer .
p8007
aVIt has been a long time since I 've owned a new camera and I know that I have made a solid choice with the GH2 .
p8008
aVI 'm off to film and photograph the world .
p8009
aa(lp8010
VI recently installed a cheap Zmodo DVR system on my home .
p8011
aVThe cameras that were bundled with it are terrible , with incorrect colors -LRB- black displaying purple , and green displaying brown -RRB- and awful IR performance .
p8012
aVI bought this camera as a replacement for my driveway cam and wow , what a difference .
p8013
aVThe daytime picture looks good , but the IR is 100 % better .
p8014
aVThe IR illumination has great throw .
p8015
aVThe wide angle lens works well to see the larger area .
p8016
aVThe Zmodo power supply could n't power this camera , so I did have to use the included power supply by hooking it into the Zmodo wire bundle I already ran , which worked perfectly .
p8017
aVI 'm going to purchase a few more of these to replace the junk cameras that came in my kit .
p8018
aVThe only reason I deduct one star is because the dinky mounting screw supplied with this would n't let me attach the mount to the top of the camera .
p8019
aVThere is a threaded hole there , but the screw is n't long enough to thread in .
p8020
aVOther than that small complaint , this camera is good value for the money .
p8021
aa(lp8022
VThe advantage is that it is small and light , even smaller and lighter than my cannon power shot camera .
p8023
aVThe biggst problem is battery life , it claimed that it would be capable shoot about 60 minutes continuously , but in my experience , the battery is gone before I finish all 20 minutes SD capacity -LRB- in Mpeg2 normal mode -RRB- .
p8024
aa(lp8025
VAs many others have reported , this Zr40 began eating tapes with only a few hours of use on it .
p8026
aVI have lost many precious moments recorded on tape because of the tape loading problem .
p8027
aVThe only good thing I can say about this camera is the bag was large enough to hold my Nikon P100 .
p8028
aVThe Canon is going in the trash .
p8029
aa(lp8030
VI actually purchased this camera because of the reviews and because I need something light weight that will `` do it all '' for an upcoming big trip .
p8031
aVI have 2 DSLR 's but with all the lenses that I would like to take and the amount of weight of either one , neither would be conducive to hike with .
p8032
aVThis little Camera , Canon XS40 HS , has a X35 optical zoom that is amazing .
p8033
aVI have been practicing with it and it will certainly fit the need .
p8034
aVBecause it is so versatile , I will always have the lens I need ready to capture that great shot !
p8035
aa(lp8036
VFor years I 've been looking for small camera solution for nights\u005c/evenings at clubs\u005c/discos\u005c/low light restaurants .
p8037
aVI 've gone through countless point and shoots and other small cameras , such as Canon S95 and Olympus EPL1 .
p8038
aVAll had the same problem : slow and inaccurate focusing in low light .
p8039
aVI 'd have to resort to my DSLRs in low light , which some nights I do not want to carry .
p8040
aVAlso we go to a lot of concerts and I want a good camera that I can sneak into a concert .
p8041
aVI saw a youtube review of Panasonic GH2 vs Canon 5DMark1 vs Nikon vs Oly vs some other camera where a user was attempting to autofocus in almost complete darkness .
p8042
aVWhile most cameras did not focus , GH2 just focused incredibly in low light .
p8043
aVGF1 autofocus system is supposed to be almost as good as GH2 -LRB- but not as good -RRB- .
p8044
aVI thought to myself if GF1 can autofocus half-as-good as GH2 , I will be a happy camper .
p8045
aVSo I got GF1 when Samys Camera was selling them for $ 299 .
p8046
aVI already had the 20mm F\u005c/1 .7 .
p8047
aVGot 14-42 , 45-200 and a viewfinder , and a flash on a way .
p8048
aVWhat I can say with GF1 is that other than my top DSLRs , like full frame Nikon D700 , GF1 autofocusing in low to no light is clearly better than any point-and-shoot I 've ever tried and olympus m4\u005c/3 cameras .
p8049
aVMajority of the time I use it with 20mm F\u005c/1 .7 which makes it pocketable .
p8050
aVI get more keepers than with any of these other small cameras .
p8051
aVI use it with 45-200 at concerts and get superb results .
p8052
aVOverall I am pretty happy .
p8053
aVI wish the new generation beyond GF2 will get even better autofocusing speed\u005c/accuracy , alike GH2 and better , that will make it terrific .
p8054
aVSo I can use my DSLR at day , and GF1 at night , perfect combination
p8055

VI purchased this for my 10 yr old son .
p8057
aVI was surprised at how , well , cheap it appeared .
p8058
aVWe took it out of the box and turned it on and it would not work at first , then it worked for about 10 minutes , then it never worked again and we had to return it .
p8059
aVAmazon was great during the return process and refunded our money quickly .
p8060
aVWe ended up buying the DGX 5.1 MP from a local store i it 's place .
p8061
aVIt has worked well for my son and is holding up to the rigors of youth .
p8062
aVNot a professional photography instrument , but a pretty decent unit for him .
p8063
aa(lp8064
VI 've owned and tested a new Sony CX series camcorder each year since the CX7 .
p8065
aVI 'm extremely impressed with the Sony CX160 for ground footage .
p8066
aVTesting it the other night when my friends rode bulls for the first time -LRB- `` Dysfunctional Bull Riding '' on youtube -RRB- I was impressed on the active steadyshot being able to minimize my hand held shaking while the camera was heavily zoomed in .
p8067
aVThe low lux made the above video super bright even in a dark arena .
p8068
aVThe external mic is nice to have back on a consumer level CX series camera .
p8069
aVI personally do n't like the built in USB cable since I tend to mount my cameras in boxes and helmets but for the average joe , it 's nice not to look for a USB cable .
p8070
aVThe other plus with this camera is you can now charge through this cable .
p8071
aVTherefore a standard USB charger port in your car or computer can charge the camera .
p8072
aVThis takes longer than the standard Sony charger but nice in a pinch .
p8073
aVI 've noticed the USB downloading speeds are extremely slow in this camera .
p8074
aVIt takes a minute or so to download a 200mb clip from internal memory .
p8075
aVYou also can not run the footage straight off the camera like you could with the 150 .
p8076
aVSpeaking of footage .
p8077
aVThe quality out of this camera is awesome !
p8078
aVI 'm super impressed by the image quality .
p8079
aVI dropped this down by a point since I use these cameras for skydiving and the optical stabilization -LRB- OIS -RRB- causes flutter when the camera is in a vacuum caused by certain body positions .
p8080
aVI could see this being an issue with people mounting these in certain positions on motorcycles or other fast moving vehicles where there is not laminar airflow around the camera .
p8081
aV-LRB- youtube `` Sony HDR-CX160 Tests '' -RRB- .
p8082
aVSony needs to lock the stabilization optics when the stabilization is turned off !
p8083
aVOverall I 'm going to keep this camera for ground footage but going back to my EIS based Sony HDR-CX150 camera for extreme sports .
p8084
aVThx , Trunk HYPOXIC Extreme Electronics

aa(lp8086
VThis is my first digital camera .
p8087
aVI was doing research for about 6 month already until I settled for S3 IS .
p8088
aVI was comparing many of them and Canon was able to offer more than its competitors were .
p8089
aVI have been using camera a couple of days now and I am very pleased with the results .
p8090
aVI am in the process of experimenting and I think every new user should do that .
p8091
aVI was reading many reviews with comments on poor picture quality in low light settings and similar , but I think it is just matter of practice and knowledge .
p8092
aVAs per my experience , if you put camera in low light settings and put the flash on , pictures are very good .
p8093
aVCamera like Canon S3 IS requires you to go through the manual and make yourself familiar with many of its options .
p8094
aVAdjustable LCD viewfinder is very helpful especially if you are taking pictures above your height\u005c/sight of to low .
p8095
aVPersonally , I would like for the flash to open itself automatically , rather than manual .
p8096
aVAnother thing that I would like is for the pictures to be dated .
p8097
aVSince I have baby girl I would like my pictures to have the date on them , this way you only have date in the picture info .
p8098
aVI would recommend this camera to anyone who wants better than average , quality , and stylish product .
p8099
aVPro : Many features offered to fit any ocassion Con : My inexperience with digital cameras
p8100
aa(lp8101
VFirst of all , I am not a expert when it comes to camcorders .
p8102
aVI am a mom with two adorable children that I chase after 24-7 .
p8103
aVIn my opinion this is a wonderful camcorder for the price .
p8104
aVI recently bought it to replace a Samsung that was dropped and broken .
p8105
aVI did a lot of research on Camcorders before choosing this one and one thing I learned is that most of the bad reviews given to lower model cameras come from people who are what I call ametuer professionals , who should be looking at buying more expensive cameras than this one .
p8106
aVAnyway , things I like about this camera include has easy it is to transfer it to regular 8 inch dvd .
p8107
aVJust pop it into your computer and use the nero software .
p8108
aVSecond I love that it takes snapshots .
p8109
aVSure with this model they are only 1 mega pixel but most of us have another camera for taking pictures with anyway .
p8110
aVIf you want one to do both I would highly reccomend the Sony 405 that takes 4 mega pixel pictures .
p8111
aVI also love the optical zoom , although I do wish it would zoom further .
p8112
aVAll in all this camera is an excellent choice for busy parents who are not trying to make motion picture films .
p8113
aVA really great and handy camcorder .

VYou must absolutely get one g12 wheter if you are a professional photographer or you only take memoir photographs .
p8117
aVYou can control many functinos , you can add fiters and so on ... In SCN mode yo can take HDR and miniature effected pictures .
p8118
aVAnother great funciton of g12 is the smart shooter .
p8119
aVInstead of self-timer , smart shooter shoots a picture when an additional face is added to the frame ... Pros : Manual control over many functions , great picture quality , HDR and miniature effect modes , 720 p video recording , great low-light performance , good battery life Cons : You can not control parametres in HDR and minature effect modes Bottom line , it is really a great camera ...
p8120
aa(lp8121
VAfter less than two years , this recorder crashes and destroys everything I 've recorded every time I try to record on a 60 minute DVD for more than 55 minutes .
p8122
aVIt works fine as long as I remember to stop it before 55 minutes , but losing everything seems like an awfully big price to pay for losing track of the time .
p8123
aVI 've called customer support and they say it should n't do this and they do n't know why it does , and there 's nothing to be done about it since it 's not under warranty anymore .
p8124
aV-LRB- They 'll fix it for $ 300 + parts , but I 'm reluctant to pour more money into this piece of junk . -RRB-
p8125
aVFor $ 700 , I expect a product that will work reliably for more than a year !
p8126
aa(lp8127
Vthis is my second purchase for this camera .
p8128
aVlove the camera , keep one in each of my vehicles .
p8129
aVgreat zoom , easy to use and program .
p8130
aa(lp8131
Vif you do n't mind spending some time cutting and filing the hotshoe mount down on this product , then it will work just fine for you .
p8132
aVIf your looking for a perfect fit right out of the box , you might want to keep shopping around .
p8133
aVif you do spend the time , you can get a working wireless hotshoe flash trigger for pretty cheap .
p8134

VI bought this camcorder before Christmas .
p8136
aVI ca n't possibly be more pleased with it .
p8137
aVI have checked out and tried many models before purchasing this one .
p8138
aV.
p8139
aVand I 'm totally pleased with it .
p8140
aVI did n't have to come up with a huge investment for quality video with this M30 Canon .
p8141
aV.
p8142
aVit exceeds everything I expected for the money I paid .
p8143
aVI love the quality of the video and the range of video you can record .
p8144
aVI was n't concerned with the picture taking aspect of this camcorder because I wanted it for the video , so it works great for me .
p8145
aVI like the touch screen a lot .
p8146
aVIt makes it very easy to set up what you want to do .
p8147
aVThe only thing might be the software .
p8148
aVFor me , it was n't as user friendly as I like , but I had already decided to purchase another software program to edit and process my videos , so it was n't a big concern for me .
p8149
aVIt will , however , load the videos on my PC , and that is enough for me .
p8150
aVThis camcorder is very easy to use and easy to understand .
p8151
aVIt has some great functions and the Auto is usually going to do very well for you .
p8152
aVYou can set a slower frame rate in manual mode and get better quality when the light is low , so that was a great plus IMO .
p8153
aVThe `` Face Finding '' technology is great !
p8154
aVThe video quality is very good with this M30 , and I 'm sure you will like it ... especially if you are stepping up from a non HD camcorder .
p8155
aVThe difference will be very evident indeed !
p8156
aVI also found a great deal on a longer life battery for my HF M30 Canon .
p8157
aVhref="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IQOU22/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/182-1509676-0725154"> New BP-827 Li-Ion 6-Hour Rechargeable Intelligent Battery for Canon VIXIA HF10 HF11 HF100 HF20 HF200 HF S10 S100 S20 S21 S200 HG20 HG21 M30 M31 M300 Camcorders  You wo n't be able to beat this deal for a battery for this HF M30 Canon at all !
p8158
aVIt works great and is compatible .

VCelestron does make good optical devices but the Celestron C65 is n't one of them .
p8163
aVIt is severely deficient in both optical quality and quality of materials , construction and mechanical operation .
p8164
aVImage quality at 30x is passable , at 60x poor , and at 90x so dim and fuzzy as to be useless .
p8165
aVThe first one I bought arrived with a broken horizontal movement mechanism .
p8166
aVThe zoom mechanism on the replacement broke after less than 2 hours of use .
p8167
aVEven when working , the zoom and focus controls did not operate smoothly .
p8168
aVThey tended to stick and release making adjustment difficult .
p8169
aVThe light weight and tiny tripod also mean that the image is very shaky .
p8170
aVI bought this spotting scope because it was very lightweight and portable , but it seems to me that quality was sacrificed to achieve a very low price and weight .
p8171
aVIt has a `` Lifetime Warranty '' but if Celestron decides that it was not defective in workmanship or materials , -LRB- i.e. , you broke it -RRB- it will cost you $ 35 to invoke the `` no fault '' Lifetime Warranty .
p8172
aVGiven the fragility of this scope , it 's almost certain to get broken sooner rather than later , and good luck with not paying the $ 35 .
p8173
aa(lp8174
VI got mine on sale for really cheap a few years ago , about $ 250 .
p8175
aVAt the time , it was a steal for a mini dv camera .
p8176
aVAfter about a year , it had a problem loading\u005c/ejecting the tape .
p8177
aVThen it completely stopped working .
p8178
aVIt is frustrating to buy something that breaks .
p8179
aVAlso , it was terrible in low lighting situations .
p8180
aVI would recommend saving your money for a better camera .
p8181
aVIn other words , the cost vs quality is n't worth it in the end .
p8182
aa(lp8183
VI bought this camera after I realized most digital cameras do n't stay on the market for too long -- unlike film cameras in the past .
p8184
aVThe reason for saying this ?
p8185
aVWhen Fuji designed this particular model they wanted to have the best still image .
p8186
aVTo this end they put their EXR sensor , and this sensor is bigger than most sensors used in this type of camera .
p8187
aVAll my pictures come out fantastic , note that the dafault setting for picture quality is set to `` normal '' .
p8188
aVThis should be set to `` fine '' as the dafault setting is a smaller file size aimed at allowing more pictures to be stored in the memory card .
p8189
aVAll other settings should be experimented by individual owners as tastes vary .
p8190
aVI did not try video because it does not have HD quality -- I do n't mind that since I did not buy this camrea for video .
p8191
aVThe current model -LRB- Fujifilm FinePix HS10 -RRB- in the Fuji line has HD video abeit at the expense of still image quality .
p8192
aVFuji only made this model -LRB- S200EXR -RRB- for less than a year -- because they think most buyers in this catagory want HD video .
p8193
aVBut the current model does n't come with the EXR sensor .
p8194
aVThe other feature I love is the manual zoom ring on the lense barrel , it is very easy to control and reminds one on a SLR type camera .
p8195
aVIn fact the handling of this camera is so much like a SLR that buyers with previous experience should feel right at home .
p8196
aVI realize this is a general review , one can find detailed ones on the web anyway .
p8197
aVI want to give an impression of a casual user .
p8198
aVVery happy with the purchase .
p8199
aVWish they still make them .
p8200
aa(lp8201
VThis camera greatly under-performed from my expectations .
p8202
aVThe picture quality is not very good .
p8203
aVI figured it would not be the same size as a normal camera , the picture that shows the camera in the advertisement is extremely misleading .
p8204
aVWhen it showed up at my doorstep and I realized it was the size of a tic tac box I laughed !
p8205
aVI would never buy this product again -- Very disappointed !
p8206
aa(lp8207
VI purchased these binoculars for use on a 30 foot fishing boat .
p8208
aVThey work great .
p8209
aVThe image is clear and when I activate the stabilization , I can read caution and slow notice signs from a long way off .
p8210
aVI know that some reviewers have concerns about them not being waterproof .
p8211
aVAs long as you do n't drop them in the water , they seem fine .
p8212
aa(lp8213
VIt seems from the other reviews of this camera -LRB- here and elsewhere -RRB- that people either like it or hate it !
p8214
aVI have a Canon A560 that I have been satisfied with , but wanted a physically smaller camera with Image Stabilization and greater resolution .
p8215
aVThe SD1400 was well reviewed on Consumer Reports and CameraLabs.com , and had decent reviews elsewhere , so I decided to give it a shot .
p8216
aVI am mostly pleased .
p8217
aVThe images produced are very good .
p8218
aVNot great , but very good .
p8219
aVI thought I would see more detail with 14.1 megapixels , but the images produced are not substantially better than my 7MP A560 , as far as I can tell .
p8220
aVI do sometimes experience an out of focus image - not often , but probably more than I did with the A560 .
p8221
aVI also prefer to use the ` P ' -LRB- program -RRB- mode instead of the ` Auto ' mode .
p8222
aVUsually I find I have to reduce the exposure compensation a bit .
p8223
aVThe camera 's controls and features work well .
p8224
aVThe color swap and miniature modes are fun .
p8225
aVThe buttons are small , but that 's the way it goes when the camera body is miniaturized .
p8226
aVThe camera 's small size make it easy to carry anywhere , which is what I wanted .
p8227
aVMy camera was made in Japan .
p8228
aVI read elsewhere that Chinese made units may be of different\u005c/lesser quality , but I did n't find anything to verify that .
p8229
aVI would recommend this camera , but check out the new Elph units that Canon is releasing soon !
p8230
aa(lp8231
VThe Telescope has incredibly poor magnification coupled with the image reflecting on itself and the inability to stay stable enough to rotate the focus while on the stand makes it useless and not fit for purpose .
p8232
aVI did not bother to test the microscope as I have a gauge of the quality .
p8233
aVI bought this item to encourage young scientists but it will only serve to discourage them .
p8234
aVI am so glad I thought to test the product before wrapping it .
p8235
aVComplete waste of money
p8236
aa(lp8237
VI ordered this video camera because I wanted the Firewire capability without paying extra for high-end image stills -LRB- for which I already have a Kodak Digital Camera -RRB- .
p8238
aVWith a new baby on the way I wanted something inexpensive and reliable , and so far this camera has delivered on every front .
p8239
aVDo n't expect much more than an easy-to-use MiniDV camcorder with Firewire transfer and reasonable optical zoom , but if that 's what you 're in the market for , you 've found it .
p8240
aVOn another reviewer 's recommendation I added the Pinnacle Studio DV Firewire card\u005c/software bundle and I could n't be more satisfied with what I paid .
p8241
aVOnly thing keeping me from rating it 5 stars is that I have n't had it long enough to really know how well it stands up to the test of time .
p8242
aa(lp8243
VI owned a Sony Hi-8 , top-of-the-line camcorder for 5 years .
p8244
aVIt had every bell and whistle available , but broke down frequently -LRB- at very inopportune times like family reunions , kids ' firsts , etc. -RRB- .
p8245
aVI recently purchased the 310 after doing some research .
p8246
aVIt is LIGHT YEARS beyond the one I replaced !
p8247
aVThe color is truer , the controls are cleaner and less noisy , and the digital capability is tremendous !
p8248
aVThe LCD swing-out screen is bright and crisp , and the B viewfinder is sharp -LRB- and does n't consume much battery life -RRB- .
p8249
aVSpeaking of batteries , go for the extra 10hour battery .
p8250
aVYou will add a little size and weight to the unit , but the extra time is well worth the $ 130 or so .
p8251
aVSony has come a long way in the last 5 years , and I highly recommend this camcorder .
p8252
aVWe just recorded a live theater performance , and the video\u005c/audio are better than anything else we 've seen .
p8253

VI bought a DCR-TRV19 ~ 18 months ago and have been very happy with it until a week ago .
p8255
aVOut of the blue , it stopped being able to record .
p8256
aVLike another reviewer stated , all other functions are retained .
p8257
aVWhen recording it will record the audio w\u005c/o video .
p8258
aVIt 's like the camera ca n't `` see '' anymore .
p8259
aVSony will repair it , but only by charging you ~ 250.00 .
p8260
aa(lp8261
VI have owned this camera for several years now and it is an awesome camera .
p8262
aVI have taken thousands of photos with it and they always come out great .
p8263
aVThe zoom is quite good and the camera is quick .
p8264
aa(lp8265
VWhen I ordered this adapter I did n't know what to expect , there was so many mixed reviews .
p8266
aVBut when I placed the order I received it with in a week , and once I had it I hooked it up , and paired it with my phone LG THRILL I used the App Tourque from the play market and had no problems pairing the two together , my feed back from my ECU 2001 ford focus zx3 was fast and responsive I was skeptical on how fast the feed back would be since it was bluetoot , but it had no lag at all !
p8267
aVI would recommend this product if you do n't want to buy a kiwi OBDII ADAPTER , this product is awesome I had a little trouble pairing the two after a week though I knew it worked so it had to be my phone so I poped out my battery and poped it back in and it worked perfectly .
p8268
aVAnd still has !
p8269
aa(lp8270
VWe now have two sets of these binoculars .
p8271
aVWe have used them extensively from our ranch in Montana to our frequent trips to Yellowstone National Park .
p8272
aVExcellent clear viewing for the price !
p8273
aa(lp8274
VFor a camcorder at this micro size , the Veho Muvi Pro delivers amazingly clear videos and sound .
p8275
aVI 've used it in night club settings where the lights are dim and have not been disappointed in the end products .
p8276
aVThe voice activation feature is a plus and works well as a security camcorder .
p8277
aVHopefully , when Veho upgrades the Muvi Pro , they will include the still photo feature in the new model .
p8278
aa(lp8279
VWe have had this camera for a couple of years .
p8280
aVBought for our 9 year old to use .
p8281
aVOverpriced for what it does , especially in 2010 .
p8282
aVHowever , the user interface in this camera has one HUGE fatal flaw - it will silently erase all pictures stored on the memory card without telling you .
p8283
aVIf you connect the camera to a computer to download pictures with it still in camera -LRB- verses picture viewing -RRB- mode it will erase ALL photos in the camera without asking or confirming .
p8284
aVYou must turn on the camera , switch to viewing mode , then connect to the computer via USB .
p8285
aVIf you forget to switch to view mode before connecting to the computer , you will lose all your photos .
p8286
aVAnd you will forget , and make this mistake .
p8287
aVMore than once .
p8288
aVAnd really really regret buying a product that should never have been released .
p8289
aVThis really shows how far HP has fallen in product quality .
p8290
aVAmazing that a company would have the nerve -LRB- or stupidity -RRB- to sell a product with such a bad user interaction flaw .
p8291
aa(lp8292
VI got this to keep an eye on my free-roaming puppy while I 'm at work , and this cam has done the job well .
p8293
aVSetting it up to stream audio\u005c/video over the web was easy , wifi configuration was easy , the user interface on the cam 's webpage is intuitive , and pan\u005c/tilt work very well too .
p8294
aVThe image is grainy and low rez -LRB- 640x480 -RRB- , and the audio is noisy , but that is not uncommon for cams at this price point , particularly when streamed over the internet .
p8295
aVI set this up , and set up a Ventrilo chat client , so not only can I see puppy , I can also yell at puppy remotely when she is misbehaving .
p8296
aVShe has n't been on the white couch in weeks .
p8297
aV: D
p8298
aa(lp8299
VTo start with the positive aspects of this camera first , it has a nice red color and the time is in 24 hours and you can also adjust the date format .
p8300
aVIt also allows you to define a lot of settings yourself , so you do not have to deal with automatic settings .
p8301
aVAlso it has a relatively large display so you can view the image .
p8302
aVI also think it is quite easy to operate in general .
p8303
aVTo set the basic shooting modes with a little wheel is a very good idea .
p8304
aVHowever , otherwise it is basically a quite expensive piece of junk !
p8305
aVIt is probably one of the slowest digital cameras on the planet .
p8306
aVI do n't know what happened to Canon , but they must have thought to design a retro-camera with readout out times you had with the first digital cameras about 15 years ago .
p8307
aVUnbelievable !
p8308
aVIf you want to make any kind of photo of a moving object it will be moved out of the picture by the time you can shoot the photo .
p8309
aVEven if you try to take a photo of a static object the quality of the photo is poor .
p8310
aVIt is grainy , noisy , and blurry .
p8311
aVI have set the camera to 80 ASA , the Fine resolution and 14.1 Mpix and still got grainy noisy photos .
p8312
aVThe optics is poor , too .
p8313
aVAll photos show a blurring which you 'll get from scattered light in the optical system .
p8314
aVMy son has a $ 25 Vivitar camera which is not only significantly faster , but the images are only slightly worse .
p8315
aVNow you wo n't expect an excellent photos with a $ 25 camera , but you can expect some decent shots from a $ 100 camera .
p8316
aVWe also have a 4 year old Canon SD 1100IS which is a good camera , so I did expect that in 4 years Canon would have invested some money into development .
p8317
aVWell , they did , for some gimmicks , like a toy camera effect of softening for portraits .
p8318
aVHowever with this camera this is a permanent feature .
p8319
aVInstead of wasting money for gimmicks like this it would have been better spending the money on developing better optics , CCDs and readout electronics .
p8320
aVThe A2200 is basically useless , except if you like grainy , blurry images of something that does not move .
p8321
aVThen this is the camera for you .
p8322
aVSo as a conclusion , the A2200 looks nice but that it .
p8323
aVOtherwise I would not recommend this camera at all .
p8324
aVIt 's a complete waste of money .
p8325
aVMy wife actually returned it back to Walmart and got a blender instead .
p8326
aVThe money is certainly better spend that way .
p8327
aa(lp8328
VThis little add on is essential to those with the 120 .
p8329
aVI chose and love my 120 because I wanted to be able to take 120mm shots when I wanted to .
p8330
aVBut 35mm is so much easier to find and develop .
p8331
aVI love this simple attachment , it 's really simple to use and install .
p8332
aa(lp8333
VGreat camera and easy to use .
p8334
aVConvenient size .
p8335
aVProbably a good idea to order the Flip Video Power Adapter at the same time to allow wall plug-in charging instead of the USB port charging on your computer .
p8336
aVReally slick device .
p8337
aa(lp8338
VAlthough not very compact , I 'm still consider the camera pocket-able .
p8339
aVMoving from D-SLR to P is a big step for me .
p8340
aVI 'm carefully searching for P camera that produce excellent image quality , great manual control features , great coverage for both wide  zoom reach , sharp , and great deal on price .
p8341
aVI was considering LX5\u005c/S95 earlier but due to its price , I 'm willing to compromise the low light capability with more reach zoom on ZS7 .
p8342
aVTo my surprise , everything that I was hoping for included in this camera .
p8343
aVExcellent build quality -LRB- much better than my old canon -RRB- , super sharp lens , full customizable setting , great video performance .
p8344
aVPro : 1 .
p8345
aVExcellent build quality .
p8346
aVMetal casing from body to battery door .
p8347
aVMy old Canon SD800 battery door made from plastic .
p8348
aV2 .
p8349
aVSuper sharp lens .
p8350
aVtested indoor with maximum zoom level , I was able to get very sharp pictures .
p8351
aVJust like pic that came from my canon dslr lens .
p8352
aV3 .
p8353
aVDespite for its limitation , I can set the camera to perform up to my standard .
p8354
aVfor example , I can set the isomax to 400 , therefore I can eliminate the noise issue in low light condition .
p8355
aVAnd many more custom setting to choose from .
p8356
aVOf course I still need sturdy hand or use tripod\u005c/monopod in this situation .
p8357
aV4 .
p8358
aVGreat coverage both wide end and tele zoom .
p8359
aV12x zoom is equal to 300mm lens on DSLR .
p8360
aVwhat a great reach for such small camera !
p8361
aV5 .
p8362
aVExcellent image quality  smart camera .
p8363
aVI do n't have to decide whether I want to shoot macro , landscape or portrait .
p8364
aVthe camera can adjust itself depending on your situation .
p8365
aVvery smart !
p8366
aV6 .
p8367
aVCool video reproduction w \u005c/ stereo sound .
p8368
aVPanasonic seems to think outside the box how to overcome the camera limitation .
p8369
aVThe zoom function for example will move slow during video recording .
p8370
aVThis allow us to get smoother movement and reduce zoom motor noise .
p8371
aVContinuous AF also supported .
p8372
aVYou can get similar result like the one recorded with camcorder .
p8373
aVWorry about the AVCHD lite format ?
p8374
aVGood news is you can change the video format to motion JPEG which widely used by all video editing software including windows movie maker .
p8375
aVFor me , I like AVCHD better since I can take full video movie features that this camera promise .
p8376
aV7 .
p8377
aVGPS functionality .
p8378
aVautomatically tag the photo  videos by detecting point of interest location from around the world .
p8379
aVJust make sure you turn off this GPS features if you do n't needed as it will drain your battery even when your camera in off position .
p8380
aV8 .
p8381
aVexcellent 11 points AF tracking  continuous tracking .
p8382
aVThis camera also can remember your face -LRB- up to 6 faces -RRB- and prioritize the focus on these faces .
p8383
aV9 .
p8384
aVManual depth of field control .
p8385
aVWhether you want blur background or sharp landscape shot , everything that you could possibly dream of from DSLR , you can have it in here .
p8386
aV10 .
p8387
aVVarious scene selection .
p8388
aVsome of my favorites : pin hole -LRB- vignetting effect -RRB- , High dynamic -LRB- HDR -RRB- .
p8389
aVUpdate : Just found other cool things .
p8390
aVSome of the scene selections can be applied toward video as well .
p8391
aVFor example you can have vignetting effect with desaturated color when recording movies .
p8392
aVThis is very cool !
p8393
aVCons : 1 .
p8394
aVNo manual video control .
p8395
aVI wish it has manual aperture control during video recording like LX-5 .
p8396
aV2 .
p8397
aVsmall aperture .
p8398
aVIf the camera has larger aperture like f\u005c/2 .8 , it will have better result in lowlight shot .
p8399
aV3 .
p8400
aVLight streak during video recording .
p8401
aVExposing to bright light , the video can produce light streak during recording .
p8402
aVThis is not the camera fault .
p8403
aVIt is CCD sensor issue that applied to any camera using the same sensor .
p8404
aVSome new camera used backlit MOS sensor to overcome this issue but there is a trade in effect which reduce still shot image quality compare to CCD sensor .
p8405
aVFor me I 'm still choosing CCD over Backlit-MOS .
p8406
aa(lp8407
VThis camera is great .
p8408
aVI have used it for dog videos so far and the flyball races were amazing in 1080p .
p8409
aVWhile I recommend the camera it is only fair to mention its two faults .
p8410
aVFirst the original battery is worthless as anything other than a backup I purchased a BP819 and it is great , what should have come on the camera .
p8411
aVSecond the field of view could be wider , not terrible but depending on your intended use it may be an issue .
p8412
aa(lp8413
VThe camera works really well and we 've had it now almost 2 years .
p8414
aVMy wife dropped it on the road and cement floors a few times accidentally but it still works -LRB- although the exterior is banged up a bit -RRB- .
p8415
aVOne person indicated that it 's really hard to transfer video to a PC .
p8416
aV.
p8417
aVWe have no problems at all using Pinnacle Studio to do transfers and then copy to DVD .
p8418
aV-LRB- thru the doc station fire-wire -RRB-

Vif you are planning to purchase a camera to upload your videos to youtube do not buy this one .
p8421
aVwhen you upload videos there is no sound on the playback and they have no fix for it as of yet .
p8422
aVtoshiba is aware of it and said they are working on it .
p8423
aVif you want it to record and play back to watch on your computer or TV it is great .
p8424
aa(lp8425
V\u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* The Bottom Line \u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* This is a very good and versatile point-and-shoot camera .
p8426
aVIf you are just interested in taking good pictures under a variety of shooting conditions then this camera delivers .
p8427
aVHowever , the video format that lacks support of many video organizing and editing programs leaves me disappointed .
p8428
aVVideo has become such an important part of what we 've come to expect from cameras and it would have been nice to have as many uploading , editing , and viewing options as possible .
p8429
aVI wish that this Cyber-shot camera were much better in that department .
p8430
aV\u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* Picture Quality \u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* If taking great pictures is the thing that 's the most important for you in a camera , then this little shooter will not disappoint .
p8431
aVThe pictures are very vivid and sharp .
p8432
aVThe 16-megapixel sensor will allow you to capture images that will be easy to view even on the largest monitors .
p8433
aVThe 2.4 F lens delivers bright pictures that are as distortion-free as one could expect from this sort of camera .
p8434
aV\u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* Build Quality \u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* This is a very well built and sturdy looking camera .
p8435
aVIt is slightly larger than the current crop of Canon Powershots .
p8436
aVNonetheless it is still not very bulky and it 's very convenient for taking with you anywhere you go .
p8437
aV\u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* Ease of Use \u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* Considering the complexity and versatility of things that you can do with this camera , the user interface is not too bad .
p8438
aVHowever , it is still not overly intuitive , and you will have to dig deep within various menus if you are interested in taking the full advantage of all the options that this camera offers .
p8439
aV\u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* Video \u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* The vide quality is very good .
p8440
aVHowever , if you want to record video at the highest quality -LRB- full HD 1080\u005c/60i -RRB- you 'll have to do so in AVCHD format .
p8441
aVThis is a video format used by Sony and Panasonic , and hardly anyone else .
p8442
aVWhen viewing videos on HDTV directly from a camera or from a hard drive the results can be stunning .
p8443
aVI made a short video of my neighborhood right at the time that the school bus was passing by .
p8444
aVThe video was incredibly sharp and vivid , and I felt like it was shot in some tony suburb .
p8445
aVHowever , this video format is not very friendly with most of the picture\u005c/video management software , including most troublingly iPhoto and Picasa .
p8446
aVOverall this video format is incompatible with most of Mac software .
p8447
aVI was only able to play it with programs like VLC or Adobe Premiere , but even then the interlacing artifacts were very noticeable and distracting .
p8448
aVThe description of this camera claims that these video files can be edited in iMovie , but I have not been able to import AVCHD files into either iMovie 2009 or 2011 .
p8449
aVOn Windows systems the situation is much better .
p8450
aVSeveral standard Windows video players -LRB- including Windows Media Player -RRB- support AVCHD natively and play these files without any annoying interlacing artifacts .
p8451
aVThe same holds for video editing programs .
p8452
aVThe other format that this camera supports is mp4 .
p8453
aVThis format allows you to shoot videos in a progressive 30p mode , but you sacrifice the resolution - these videos are not recorded in full HD format .
p8454
aVOne of the main advantages \u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* Connections and File Transfer \u005c*\u005c*\u005c* The camera connects to the computer and the charger through a proprietary USB cord .
p8455
aVThis is not so much of a problem for transferring photos and videos -LRB- since you can in most cases do it directly from the memory card -RRB- , but it is an issue when it comes to charging your camera .
p8456
aVI am all too familiar with how easy it is to misplace one of these cords , and since it is nonstandard you can not avail of any of your other USB cords .
p8457
aVThis is especially annoying when you travel , as you have to remember to bring a separate USB cord for each one of your devices .
p8458
aV\u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* Preset Shooting Modes \u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* This camera has many preset shooting modes that are convenient for all sorts of shooting conditions : low light , landscape , lots of motion , soft backgrounds , beach , fireworks , etc. .
p8459
aVBecause of so many various options all of them had to get a separate menu .
p8460
aVOne shooting mode that I was really impressed with was the background correction HDR .
p8461
aVThis mode allows you to take pictures of situations that have a very high contrast between well lit and underlit parts .
p8462
aVFrom what I gathered HDR in this camera was accomplished with three shots in rapid succession at various exposure settings .
p8463
aVI 've been able to take really nice photographs of a dark room with large bright windows .
p8464
aVOne feature that I was really looking forward to is the Background Defocus .
p8465
aVThis feature aims to emulate the shallow depth of field that makes the DSLR photographs so dramatic .
p8466
aVUnfortunately , this feature only works with taking pictures of faces , presumably because it relies on facial recognition to distinguish the foreground from the background .
p8467
aV\u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* Some Other Observations \u005c*\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* \u005c* The 3D features work OK .
p8468
aVOnly one of the three different 3D settings allows you to view 3D pictures directly on your camera , while for the other two you need to attach the camera to a 3D enabled TV or monitor .
p8469
aVIMHO , 3D is more of a gimmick than a really well implemented feature .
p8470
aV\u005c* The panorama feature is really neat .
p8471
aVYou just sweep the camera across the landscape that you want to turn into a panorama , and the camera stitches the photos automatically .
p8472
aVTurning photos into panoramas can be very tricky and oftentimes requires very sophisticated software .
p8473
aVThis camera takes away all of that difficulty .
p8474
aVThe price you pay , though , is that the panorama shots will be lower resolution than the highest quality pictures .
p8475
aVThey will essentially be the same resolution as the HD video .
p8476
aV\u005c* Face recognition works great , and the camera locks onto faces very quickly .
p8477
aV\u005c* Various timer options give you plenty of choices .
p8478
aVMy favorite timer option relies on face recognition - the camera will wait until it recognizes a face -LRB- or two -RRB- and then take the picture within two seconds .
p8479
aV\u005c* The shooting speed is very impressive .
p8480
aVI can take pictures even faster than with my Canon DSLR camera .
p8481
aVPoint and shoot cameras have really come a long way in this department .
p8482
aV\u005c* The 7X zoom is very effective .
p8483
aVThis is one of the largest zooms in this camera category and it certainly delivers on high expectations .
p8484
aVOverall , this is a very good camera , especially at its price .
p8485
aVMy rating would be 4.5 stars , but since Amazon only deals in full-star ratings I 'll give it 5 .
p8486
aa(lp8487
VI did a very short research on binoculars -LRB- read articles on bestbuy.com and test several of them -RRB- , cause I want to have it soon .
p8488
aVWe need one to use in theater when we watch opera .
p8489

aVSo I chose bushnell 4x30 which has about 670 field of view at the beginning .
p8492
aVThen I bought bushnell 8x25 , and Nikon Medallion 8x21 -LRB- because this is most expensive one among compact binoculars in the nearby bestbuy -RRB- .
p8493
aVWhen using them outdoors in a bright afternoon when we walked in a garden , there is not much difference betw .
p8494
aVthose three , only bushnell 4x30 has smaller view .
p8495
aVBut if you just watch the leaves nearby , all of them are good .
p8496
aVWe took all the binoculars to the theater .
p8497
aVBushnell 4 \u005c* 30 has too small view than the other two .
p8498
aVAnd Nikon 8x21 produce brighter and clearer view then Bushnell 8x and you really can tell the quality of the view by eyes .
p8499
aVI highly recommend Nikon 8x21 Medallion .
p8500
aVIt is cheap and has cool shape and color .
p8501
aV Finally I decide to purchas Nikon 10x25 because this one has higher power , waterproof -LRB- I thought it may be used longer -RRB- and more compact and only $ $ $ higher than Nikon 8x21 .\u000aNN RB PRP VBP TO VB NNP NN IN DT CD VBZ JJR NN , JJ -LRB- PRP VBD PRP MD VB VBN RBR -RRB- CC RBR JJ CC RB $ $ $ JJR IN NNP NN .\u000a finally I decide to purcha Nikon 10x25 because this one have higher power , waterproof -lrb- I think it may be use longer -rrb- and more compact and only $ $ $ higher than Nikon 8x21 .\u000a\u000a\u000aIt is really an excellent compact binoculars with price under $ $ $ .\u000aPRP VBZ RB DT JJ JJ NNS IN NN IN $ $ $ .\u000ait be really a excellent compact binoculars with price under $ $ $ .\u000a\u000a

p8503
aa(lp8504
VI purchased the first camera in Nov 11 First time I tried to use it for more than 5 minutes , the battery failed , and would not accept a charge .
p8505
aVReturned it to Amazon for replacement .
p8506
aVSecond camera failed the same way , even quicker than the first .
p8507
aVThat failure occured on the same day that KODAK announced they were going into Chapter 11 .
p8508
aVIf this is an example of their quality , its no wonder .
p8509
aVThe only really good things about this experience , is it showed how great Amazon 's return policy is , and reduces the number of brands of cameras I will have to consider in the future .
p8510
aa(lp8511
VI had bought this Camcorder 4 months ago and now that I am about to leave for vacation the lens cover -LRB- shutter -RRB- does not open .
p8512
aVI called Sony and told them about this and they asked me to send this to one of their service center and asked to pay $ 150 upfront for labor charge .
p8513
aVOther drawback is that for outdoor shooting 5.1 audio captures too much wind noise .
p8514
aVI am very unhappy with Sony quality in recent products I bought .
p8515
aVI `` WAS '' a Sony fan but no more .
p8516
aVI have a 2 year old Mini-DV Camecorder in which the Mini-DV does not come out .
p8517
aVYou pay BIG bucks for very poor quality .
p8518
aVStay away from Sony products ... there are other better products for half the price
p8519
aa(lp8520
VIf you 're looking for a tiny miniDV camcorder , especially if you want to do widescreen 16:9 recording now or in the future , this is the model .
p8521
aVThe HC40 is about 32 cubic inches , and very lightweight .
p8522
aVIt can fit in a small-medium size camera bag , or in a large pocket .
p8523
aVMuch easier to take with you than larger camcorders .
p8524
aVIf you do n't care about size , there are some discontinued models you might find for much less , like Panasonic DV-53 , or the Sony TRV22 or 19 .
p8525
aVUnlike the HC20 or HC30 , this model provides a high quality widescreen mode , with little or no loss of data when using widescreen .
p8526
aVInstead of just putting black bars on the top and bottom of the screen , you actually record a wider area when in widescreen mode , and the image is stretched to fit normally on the tape , filling the screen with a distorted stretched image .
p8527
aVYou can then use your TV setting to compress the image to widescreen 16:9 .
p8528
aVI 've tried it , and do n't notice any loss in quality compared to 4:3 mode .
p8529
aV-LRB- To evaluate , I also looked at the stretched image compared to 4:3 , to make a more fair comparison .
p8530
aVIt 's hard to make a true comparison . -RRB-
p8531
aVDoing direct A\u005c/B comparisons on an HDTV , the image seems a little better than the Sony TRV19 -LRB- 19 is similar model to the 22 -RRB- in medium indoor light , but much worse in low light .
p8532
aVHowever , the motor noise is much quieter than on the TRV19 .
p8533
aVIf you want to do low light recording , less than 100 watts incandescent in small area , you might want to get a camcorder with a larger sensor .
p8534
aVThis sensor is only 1\u005c/5 inch .
p8535
aVThe menus are customizable , which is very convenient .
p8536
aVYou can make your own menus for each camera mode .
p8537
aVThe lens cover switch is a nice touch -- no lens cap .
p8538
aVThe battery is small , but still has about the same capacity as last year 's larger one .
p8539
aVThe LCD display has a new feature which makes use of external light .
p8540
aVIt is much more visible in bright sunlight , and you can turn the backlight off , saving the battery .
p8541
aVAn s-video\u005c/composite\u005c/audio cable is included .
p8542
aVOne end is a small plug similar in size to iLink , and the other end of the cable has audio  video plugs .
p8543
aVUnfortunately the viewfinder does not tilt upwards like other models .
p8544
aVAnd , you ca n't slide it out halfway to make extreme diopter adjustments ; you can only turn a dial to make the normal adjustment .
p8545
aVI ca n't use the viewfinder without my eyeglasses , because I have a strong prescription .
p8546
aVThe photos are terrible ; I wish camcorders would eliminate this feature , and focus on better video .
p8547
aVThe strap is nice , but can not be removed .
p8548
aVMakes fitting in a small bag more difficult .
p8549
aVSony camcorders are reputed to have great automatic point-and-shoot capability , including this model .
p8550
aVWhen steadyshot is on indoors , the camera tries to set shutter speed at 1\u005c/100 to reduce blur .
p8551
aVBut if there is n't enough light , it will step down to 1\u005c/60 .
p8552
aVGain is only applied after the aperture has opened completely and the shutter has reached 1\u005c/60 .
p8553
aVWhen using a tripod , you can shut off steadyshot , and the camera will automatically use 1\u005c/60 shutter , to allow a smaller aperture for better focus , or in low light , less gain for a better picture .
p8554
aVThese adjustments are made very quickly , and very intelligently .
p8555
aVYou can display the settings the camera chooses on screen while recording or in playback .
p8556
aVWonderful camcorder , glad I got it !
p8557
aa(lp8558
VGreat Picture !!
p8559
aVGreat Product !!
p8560
aVI love it !
p8561
aVDo n't underestimate this video camera , it 's perfect for the price .
p8562
aVThe software is way to easy ... Excellent Deal !!
p8563
aa(lp8564
VI felt the price was very competitive and it was received within the time frame the seller told me it would be .
p8565
aVThe camera is very easy to handle and has so far taken wonderful shots .
p8566
aVIt was just what I was hoping it would be .
p8567
aa(lp8568
VI 've been using the 5N for 4 months now , and have to say I 'm VERY impressed , having tried various DSLRs and Panasonic\u005c/Olympus '' `` EVIL '' systems .
p8569
aVI waited for a couple months for the NEX 7 , but am glad I stopped waiting .
p8570
aVWhile the 7 has a higher pixel count the 5N is far better in low light , and is significantly smaller and lighter .
p8571
aVHow many times do you really need over 16 Mega Pixels ?
p8572
aVAlso , the cost of the 5N is literally 50 % less .
p8573
aVThe 5N has been the IDEAL travel camera -LRB- we just returned from the BVI -RRB- : pocketable with the 16mm and an after market 28mm Russian lens using the Leica M-39 adapter .
p8574
aVI HIGHLY recommend this camera , as well as the 18-55 lens , the 16mm and the fisheye adapter and an extra battery , as well as a large fast memory chip -LRB- 64GB Komputer Bay class 10 works very well -RRB- ; and the extra audio adapter -LRB- but only if you plan to take advantage of the excellent 1080p video -RRB- .
p8575
aVThe bottom line : with many cameras available , this this the one I use constantly ... not to mention the rest of my family , who also have very nice fancy cameras of their own , but all prefer mine .
p8576
aVPROS : Small , light weight , solid , high quality , reliable .
p8577
aVBest available ergonomics .
p8578
aVExcellent features .
p8579
aVExcellent sharpness , color saturation and low light performance .
p8580
aVHDR built-in works well , but is better if you increase the range + - 4-6 .
p8581
aVThe flash works surprisingly well - at close range , but be careful to remove lens `` sun-guards '' to avoid a possible small flash shadow effect -LRB- also sometimes need higher f-stop to avoid overexposure -RRB- .
p8582
aVFeels fantastic in your hand .
p8583
aVNice display screen , with excellent display options .
p8584
aVCons : Nothing major - but it can always be better : `` Native '' E-Lens selection is still somewhat limited , although the only thing I really want that is missing now is a good light weight , lower f-stop fixed telephoto -LRB- 100-200mm -RRB- that has the built-in auto focus  anti shake features -LRB- Available already with adapters -RRB- .
p8585
aVAlso know , that it will take some getting used -- to learn all the many , many features available , especially if this is your first Sony NEX .
p8586
aV-- Practice , and get a good guide book .
p8587
aa(lp8588
VThis camera has received a lot of good reviews , but as other S7000 owners have commented , it does n't take as good pictures as the S7000 .
p8589
aVIt seems to me that they cut corners on this camera to pay for the larger lens .
p8590
aVThere is a USB port , not a USBII port , and the door for it is flimsy rubber .
p8591
aVThe manual zoom does not produce better results .
p8592
aVThe faster shutter speed seems to give less focus time , producing pictures that are less focused .
p8593
aVI know that there are those who like this camera ... and I am mainly writing to those who have the Fuji S7000 .
p8594
aVDo n't sell that camera until you try the S9000 .
p8595
aVI 'm glad that I still have mine .
p8596
aa(lp8597
VI got two XF100s for my event videography business and after 6 months of use I can definitely say that these should not be considered a professional video camera .
p8598
aV.
p8599
aVBut I 'll start with the good .
p8600
aVWhat I like about the camera : The camera body is very small and light .
p8601
aVWhat I hate about this camera : The main problem with this camera is that it is almost unusable in anything close to low light .
p8602
aVThe Noise produced at even moderate gain settings is enormous .
p8603
aVI have had to use de-noising software on almost all the footage from this camera and that creates other problems with quality .
p8604
aV.
p8605
aVThe button placements are not ideal for ease of use .
p8606
aVthere is only one ring that has to be used for focus\u005c/zoom\u005c/iris adjustment .
p8607
aVSo you have to press a button behind the screen in order to switch .
p8608
aVJust not as user friendly as it could have been but not really too big a deal if you are not using it in a run and gun situation .
p8609
aV.
p8610
aVThe viewfinder is unusable .
p8611
aVMust use the screen which is not as high-res as the Canon SLRs .
p8612
aVYes the specs on this camera are impressive for the price but in actual use the single 1\u005c/3 sensor can not handle the job .
p8613
aV.
p8614
aVFor the same price you could get a canon slr that , while being much less easy to use , will produce much better footage .
p8615
aVSo unless you plan on using this camera on using this camera in perfectly lit conditions , STAY AWAY !
p8616
aa(lp8617
VExcellent camera !
p8618
aVI love it !
p8619
aVIt 's very slim and takes great photos with excellent quality !
p8620
aVPanoramic feature it 's great and fun !
p8621
aVI just love my new camera !
p8622
aa(lp8623
VI just got this camera at a very good price from Amazon .
p8624
aVAfter trying it out last night and this morning , I found it 's easily the best pocket camera -LRB- for the price -RRB- that I have ever used .
p8625
aVI have been liking and using the Fujifilm P for years , but I just found this Panasonic ZS7 is better in most areas except the lower light and macro shots .
p8626
aVIts auto -LRB- iA -RRB- mode works really really well and the GPS function exceeds my expectation .
p8627
aVIt picks up the signal and tracks the location very well .
p8628
aVThe video quality is very good at 720p .
p8629
aVFor the previous reviewer who has problem to view the video , K-Lite Codec Pack could help .
p8630
aVThe Fuji P has less noise in lower light and better focus in macro .
p8631
aVThe package of Fuji 10x ones is smaller and more portable .
p8632
aVThis ZS7 is better in features and video quality .
p8633
aVThe ZS7 has better outdoor pictures while the Fuji ones are better indoors .
p8634
aVWith installed FastStone image viewer and Google Earth , the image viewer could launch Google Earth to show where you were in the picture .
p8635
aVIt 's truly an amazing and eye-opening experience .
p8636
aa(lp8637
VThis is an excellent camcorder .
p8638
aVVirtually brand new and had many features ... especially the LCD panel .
p8639
aVTech for Less was outstanding for assistance in operating manual and quick shipping .
p8640
aVHard to find a VHS-C camcorder toady when everything is digital .
p8641
aVCan now play all my old tapes .
p8642
aa(lp8643
VI just got this camera today and have already decided to return it .
p8644
aVMy first problem was the graininess of the photos .
p8645
aVEven on the highest quality setting in good lighting , the photos were grainy .
p8646
aVI was willing to overlook that since I bought this as a camcorder and not as a camera .
p8647
aVBut I was stunned by how loud the motor is on this thing .
p8648
aVWhen I played back my video , it sounded like I recorded it standing next to an airplane that was about to take off .
p8649
aVI was hoping to use this camera to record a seminar , but the video would be useless with all that noise from the camera drowning out the speaker .
p8650
aVI got a really good deal on it and thought it would be a shame to have to return it , but there 's no point in having a video camera that requires you to dub over all the videos you record because of noisy playback .
p8651
aVIt also does n't make sense to me that you have to go into the camera 's menus to get the LCD light to turn on .
p8652
aVI think an on\u005c/off switch somewhere on the camera would have made more sense and would have been easier to use .
p8653
aVPersonally , I do not like what 's available on the market for ANY digital camcorders I 've seen that are in the home-user price range .
p8654
aVI think I 'm going to downgrade back to Hi8 and just take my chances that I 'll be able to find a place that stills sells the tapes .
p8655
aa(lp8656
VThe Canon t2i is perfect for beginners in professional photography .
p8657
aVThe lens allows a wide range of use , although a more lightful aperture and a faster focusing would be welcome .
p8658
aVIt is light and easy to use one .
p8659
aVThe basic settings are clear .
p8660
aVAt a glance , I am completely satisfied with it and I recommend with confidence .
p8661
aa(lp8662
VLet me start out by saying that photography is my passion and I have even invested in photograpy classes in the past .
p8663
aVWas skeptical of spending alot of money to risk something getting ruined .
p8664
aVBUT ; This Kodak EasyShare C123 works great and is a great value for the cost .
p8665
aVI 've used it in the tub with the kids , in a tropical storm , and took on vacation to use in the pool and ocean .
p8666
aV.
p8667
aVeven used while climbing waterfalls in Jamaica .
p8668
aVWith any underwater camera it should be rinsed with fresh water after saltwater use .
p8669
aVSometimes it may develop condensation on lens but is easily solved by redunking or wiping with finger .
p8670
aVCa n't wait to take it to the waterpark and use on waterslides
p8671
aa(lp8672
VThis camera has an awesome zoom capability .
p8673
aVWorks great as a pair of binoculars too .
p8674
aVSome pictures will come out a little blurry if you zoom all the way -LRB- make sure you read the owner 's manual to find out some tricks to prevent that ! -RRB-
p8675
aV.
p8676
aVThe remote control feature lets you take group pictures without having to set the time , run to the group and quickly pose .
p8677
aVJust set the camera on a table -LRB- I use a tripod -RRB- , get your group together and click on the remote when you 're ready to take the picture .
p8678
aVLove my camera !
p8679
aa(lp8680
VI am not writing a long review .
p8681
aVSo I simply just have to say is , I love this K-5 camera and I am glade I got it .
p8682
aVI waited till it went down in price .
p8683
aV.
p8684
aVI will say though , she is fabulous matched with the right lens for low light photography ...
p8685
aa(lp8686
VAs soon as I turned the camera on , the lens jammed and would not close .
p8687
aVAfter 2 hours of fruitless conversation on the phone , I sent the camera back .
p8688
aa(lp8689
VI am really pleased with this camera .
p8690
aVI have bought all different types of cameras and this one is a great camera for the price .
p8691
aVMy daughter is a photographer and she has an older model of this camera and loves it .
p8692
aVShe uses it just as a point and shoot since she does n't want to lug her SLR camera everywhere .
p8693
aVWe liked the waterproof , shatterproof and freezeproof qualities .
p8694
aVShe normally only has a camera last for a year or so due to dropping it or getting it wet and this one has lasted over 2 years .
p8695
aVSo happy I took her advice and found this at such a great price .
p8696
aa(lp8697
VI was a die hard 35mm emulsion advocate until using this camera .
p8698
aVWeird since I am a Photoshop design junkie , but the 5D is defiantly the best full frame digital camera for the price , maybe since its the only one at its price right now : -RRB- If cost is less of a factor for you wait till the end of the year for the new 5D , but if you want to save a few thousand and do n't mind missing out on some of the new features , then get this kit : -RRB- The 5D and 24-105mm f\u005c/4 L IS USM Lens come as close to film as possible and surpass it where digital is able .

VI have owned a Canon camera for many years and have always loved their products .
p8702
aV6 months ago I became in desperate need of a new camera and this is the one I found .
p8703
aVOne of the things that caught my eye when reading reviews was that it can take pictures of the moon , and it DOES !
p8704
aVI love all of the different options it comes with , I have yet to discover them all .
p8705
aVMy previous Canon had a `` super-macro '' option and I do miss having it on this one .
p8706
aVThe ease of use is great .
p8707
aVI have been at a dog show and have handed my camera to a friend that is not used to this size of a camera and they were able to get great photos for me .
p8708
aVI really wish there was a hardcopy of the manual with the camera .
p8709
aVQuite often if I am using it out in the field I dont have the ability to look things up .
p8710
aVFor the price it is a great all around camera , I have recommended it to several friends .
p8711
aa(lp8712

p8713
aVIt is fairly easy to use and has good features .

VI bought this camera to test as a low-tech security device at my condo .
p8717
aVSetting it up with my wireless setup -LRB- Linksys WRV54G , no WEP -RRB- was rather easy and initially used the RJ45 jack on the camera to do the configuration and after adding the camera MAC address to my access list , the wireless part worked .
p8718
aVOn my router I had to setup port forwarding but most instructions on how to set this up is found in the user manual .

aVThe motion detection part works very quick once the camera senses motion .
p8721
aVAlmost within seconds the alert is sent out !
p8722
aVDDNS part works well and I 've noticed on Sundays for some reason the name resolution does not work for a few hours .
p8723
aVYou can still access the camera via IP address if you know what it is via internet but for some reason no name resolution for a few hours at daytime on Sundays ???
p8724
aVNot sure how some of the other reviews mentioned getting the camera working on a Mac , but I have a Mac and the camera uses Active-X for its viewer .
p8725
aVActive-X as far as I know is a Microsoft technology so it 's not supported on the few Mac browsers -LRB- Safari , Mozzilla  Firefox -RRB- I tested .
p8726
aVYes you can do some configuration with those browsers but to see the camera you 'll need Internet Explorer or any browser that can support Active-X .
p8727
aVAt work I have a PC to for vewing and if you change the camera viewer port anything other than 80 -LRB- it 's either 80 or above 1024 -RRB- , make sure you pick a port that 's open in your company 's firewall , or stick with port80 .
p8728
aVNow after testing this for about a month I can say that it has its good and bad .
p8729
aVThe motion detection is n't that great unless there 's good amount of light so the camera lens can detect motion .
p8730
aVBut the lens itself has very good image for a camera at this price .
p8731
aVSometimes the camera drops off of the network for no reason and has to be powered off and back on to get it working , that I have not figured out why .
p8732
aVBy drop off meaning you can not ping the camera or view it via http .
p8733
aVThe sound pickup on the camera is based on how good of a mic you use to detect sounds .
p8734
aVI have not tested the speaker since I have no need for it .
p8735
aVSo in conclusion I 've given it 4 stars for its performance at this price .
p8736
aVI always have it open on a browser at work and can see live video streamed for over 8-10 hrs .
p8737
aVcontinuously .
p8738
aVThe one missing star is for those times when the camera does not function for no apparent reason and within the last month that has happened twice .
p8739
aVHope this review helped .

VI 've owned a fair number of point and shoot digital cameras varing in price from the inexpensive low megapixel to the latest greatest , the later including the Leica D-Lux3 .
p8742
aVAt a cost of $ 600 this camera is disappointing .
p8743
aVNoise levels above anything but the lowest ISO very prominent the images are quite soft even when shot in RAW and converted with CS2 , which now supports the Leica .
p8744
aVThe build quality and finish of the camera are very good , but where it counts in image quality , it is no better than many cameras costing much less .
p8745
aVI purchased both the Leica and Canon 's latest 10mp Elf-size camera the SD900 and shot the same images with both for about 30 days .
p8746
aVThe Canon is still here and the Leica has been sold .
p8747
aVSad to see what was once the industry standard for quality bodies and lenses fall to such a low place .
p8748
aVI do n't see how leica will survive in the digital world generating such poor quality products .
p8749
aVI really wanted to like this camera , but not at any cost ...
p8750
aa(lp8751
VI recently bought this camera through this website .
p8752
aVAfter extensive research , I was won over by the other review here that tells of the ease of use with Macs iMovies because we were planning to purchase a new iMac .
p8753
aVWell , the new computer is here and after several days of frustration I have learned that this camera will only import video to macs with OS X 10.1-10 .3 .
p8754
aVLo and Behold all new iMacs are loaded with OS X 10.4 and this Camera is totally unable to communicate .
p8755
aVThe folks at panasonic are alternatingly clueless and unhelpful after waiting on the phone around 20 min .
p8756
aVand they do n't plan on releasing and drivers to make this brand new model of camera compatible with the brand new model of operating system !!!
p8757
aVI am at my wits end and out 800 bucks !!!!!
p8758
aa(lp8759
VThis camera took pretty good pictures for about a month , but then it broke .
p8760
aVI think the mechanism that slides the lens forward is stuck because when we try to turn it on , the display lights up , the camera makes a few honking sounds , and then it shuts down .
p8761
aVAlthough it does take movies , it 's a pain to switch to video mode .
p8762
aVThe video option is the last item under a settings menu that has multiple pages -- if you do n't know there are multiple pages , you might never find this option .
p8763
aa(lp8764
VI bought this camera brand new and took it on 2 trips to Eastern Europe in 2002 , 2003 for about 2 weeks each .
p8765
aVI liked all aspects of this camera .
p8766
aVDuring the next years I only shot about a roll each year and kept the camera stored and safe in a special cabinet .
p8767
aVI went back to Eastern Europe in 2010 and the shutter froze on the very first shot .
p8768
aVWill cost 160 dollars to repair , according to the local USA camera shop .
p8769
aVSo , I have to agree with other customers that shutter problems marr an otherwise appealing camera .
p8770
aa(lp8771
VProduct came on time , works fine ... except that one of the arrow buttons on the camera stopped working after about a week of heavy use .
p8772
aa(lp8773
VI have to start out by saying if you are a point and shoot user looking to upgrade to a DSLR , keep in mind this camera does not have `` Live View '' !
p8774
aV-LRB- The ability to take a picture using the rear screen , rather than just by looking through the viewfinder -RRB- I bought this without realizing this fact , but the camera has won me over even though my wife was thinking that was a deal breaker .
p8775
aVI went to Best Buy and played around with the D5000 , as well as the Canon XS and XSi .
p8776
aVMy quick impressions of those compared to what I had was that this camera is much easier to use .
p8777
aVI still have a lot to learn about it , but still am able to take great pictures , indoor and out .
p8778
aVThe edit feature on the camera works so well !
p8779
aVI ca n't believe all the options I have to edit within the camera without even using a computer .
p8780
aVThe package deal Amazon has with the 55-200mm VR lens as well makes this an easy choice .
p8781
aVI 've had this for about 3 weeks and those are my impressions so far .
p8782

VSoy de Nicaragua , y esta es la primera ves que tengo un par de binoculares y definitivamente son ESPECTACULARES ... las imagenes son super claras y se miran super cerca las cosas ... la luna se ve super cerca y super nitida ... es INCREIBLE !!!

VThis item was pretty hard to find .
p8788
aVI needed something basic and old school for my mom .
p8789
aVShe barely got a computer that gathers more dust than use .
p8790
aVShe was very happy with the gift .
p8791
aVSo it served its purpose well .
p8792
aa(lp8793
VIf you are looking for a DSLR for under 700 bucks this is the camera to get .
p8794
aVThis camera improves on the \u005c* ist DL in almost every way .
p8795
aVThe shake reduction is awesome , battery life is great , pictures clear , the 11-point AF is a godsend for these cameras , the kit lens is the best compared to Nikon and Canons kit lenses-it produces sharp and clear images , and the fact that it uses AA batteries and SD cards is also great .
p8796
aVMy only gripes are the slow buffer speed when it comes to continuous shooting -LRB- 3fps then 1fps -RRB- .
p8797
aVOnce again this camera is not ideal for the sport enthusiast who needs conitinous shots constantly but it still holds it 's own .
p8798
aVI also think they could of have improved the Auto-Focus a tad more -LRB- although the 11-Point AF helps greatly in lowlight and low contrast situations -RRB- .
p8799
aVThis camera is easy to hold for long periods of time especially compared to the Canon Rebel XTI model -LRB- which caused my hand to cramp up within 5 minutes of holding it -RRB- .
p8800
aVAlso , the lenses available for this camera and the prices\u005c/quality of them is unmatched .
p8801
aVIf you want to get into serious photography but do n't want to sell a first born , start with this !
p8802
aa(lp8803
VI wanted a second camera so that I could keep one on the tripod and use the Kodak on the move , this is where the stabilizer control comes in handy .
p8804
aVI rate the Playsport high because it is amazing for the price , great picture quality , easy to use , durable and light weight .
p8805
aVThe only down falls are the charging cord is temperamental and you have to use a camera light or a flashlight if your shooting in the dark .
p8806
aVI would suggest if you buy the Playsport buy a battery charger  extra battery , they are cheap on Amazon .
p8807
aVCasper
p8808
aa(lp8809
VOne of the major considerations for me in buying a camcorder was the size .
p8810
aVMy family has owned several camcorders and they 've been bulky enough that after a few months when the `` new electronics '' glow has worn off , nobody wants to lug it around on vacations , to amusement parks , camping , etc. .
p8811
aVIt 's just too much of a hassle .

VThis is the first product I have ever purchased from Samsung and have been dissatisfied with .
p8820
aVIt is a very expensive piece of -LRB- ... -RRB- The videos are fuzzy at best , there is absolutely no taking videos in dimly lit areas and the digital camera photos come out looking like black and white photos .
p8821
aVYou must change the settings from inside and outside constantly and the color is mediocre at best .
p8822
aVI also had disc errors .
p8823
aVAnything recorded prior to the disc error you lose .
p8824
aVCan be quite frustrating especially if your recording a special event .
p8825
aVI would actually give this product ZERO stars but that is n't an option .
p8826
aVIt is worth returning to best buy and losing the 15 % restocking fee .
p8827
aVSpend an extra $ 200 and buy something a little more than the low end DVD camcorder .
p8828
aa(lp8829
Vreviews prior to this one seem to have covered this camera pretty good so just point out my favorite things about this camera : 1 -RRB- exposure bracketing -LRB- i like making HDR pics -RRB- 2 -RRB- very compact size , but still has all the manual settings i need 3 -RRB- ability to save RAW + jpg 4 -RRB- smart metering , and ability to lock exposure 5 -RRB- bright , good quality lens 6 -RRB- do n't feel so bad about leaving my SLR at home when packing light !
p8830
aVi been using various canon `` elphs '' for many years , if you 're looking to upgrade your compact this is way to go .
p8831
aa(lp8832
VI 've had this camera for approximately 6 months and have only used it for a couple of vacations and I 've had 2 problems with it .
p8833
aVThe first one I noticed after only 2 months was the lens cover would not fully close when the camera was turned off .
p8834
aVThe camera still worked so I ignored this problem until just recently the lens got stuck in the extended position .
p8835
aVAt this point the camera does not work so I have to send it back for repair .
p8836
aVThis is the first canon camera I have ever had to send back for repairs .
p8837
aVFrom what I have read with other people with the same problem is Canon will claim the lens is stuck due to some type of abuse or mis-handling .
p8838
aVHopefully , this will not be the case with mine but I would stay away from this camera due to it not being able to stand up to normal use .
p8839
aVOtherwise , it was a good camera and I would be interested in hearing from anyone that can recommend a durable camera that is the same size as the 310 .
p8840
aa(lp8841
VI have owned earlier models of this camera , so the functions are familiar to me .
p8842
aVI like the handling of this camera a lot , and it has a high end look to it too .
p8843
aVVery happy with this camera !
p8844
aa(lp8845
V... the quality is completely inconsistent .
p8846
aVI have now purchased four , count them : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 of these cameras .
p8847
aVThe first one was returned because every image had a greenish yellow tint that was unnatural and could not be eliminated through white balance adjustment .
p8848
aVSo , I returned it and ordered camera number two .
p8849
aVThis one seemed to take great photos all around .
p8850
aVHowever , the glass on the the lcd , within a couple of days , was loose and wobbled around .
p8851
aVStrike two .
p8852
aVWell , let 's call it a foul tip .
p8853
aVRMA .
p8854
aVI ordered camera number three .
p8855
aVThis time , I ordered it in white instead of black , hoping maybe they come from different production facilities and may have different revisions of the build components or better quality control .
p8856
aVNope .
p8857
aVCamera number three had exactly the same issue as number one - greenish yellow tinted photos .
p8858
aVReturned .
p8859
aVI just got camera number four .
p8860
aVThe pictures are outstanding , BUT it has the same issue as camera number two with the loose glass on the back .
p8861
aVWhat gives ?
p8862
aVSeriously .
p8863
aVThis is ridiculous .
p8864
aVYou 'd think I 'd just order another brand altogether .
p8865
aVHowever , I 've already tried the Canon S95 , and this Panasonic blows it away .
p8866
aVIt 's much much faster -LRB- what 's the point of having a camera if you miss the shot because the camera does n't react in time -RRB- , the low light ability is far superior , the macro is wonderful , it can zoom while recording video , and the battery life is excellent .
p8867
aVIt has the potential to be a great camera , if only it was built better .
p8868
aVI have issues spending $ 400 on a point and shoot in the first place , more or less one that is falling apart right out of the box .
p8869
aVArggghhh !!!
p8870
aa(lp8871
VThis camera works great .
p8872
aVIt stays in my car and gets bounced around a lot .
p8873
aVI had a cheaper one -LRB- the basic polaroid model -RRB- and after any turbulace it would spit out 3 pictures at a time and none would turn out .
p8874
aVAt $ 1 a pic , that 's not cost effective .
p8875
aVI 've had no problems with this and it works great everytime I 've used it .
p8876
aVWorth the extra couple bucks .
p8877
aa(lp8878
VThis was my my first DLSR .
p8879
aVPentax made the transition clean and effortless with the K100D .
p8880
aVIt has enough auto features and modes to make things easy for one coming from P 's plus all the Control an exerienced Photgrapher could want .
p8881
aVAll this and it can take ANY K mount lens and work in Manual mode with any of them plus it can work fully auto with the AF ones .
p8882
aVThe 18-55mm kit lens was a big surprise , lotta quality for very little cash !
p8883
aa(lp8884
VNo comment .
p8885
aVEverything is OK !
p8886
aVRegards , Cristian
p8887
aa(lp8888
VSo far so good , love the camera .
p8889
aVI researched and researched , and decided between this camera and the Kodak Z981 .
p8890
aVIt was very close , but this one had a lot more reviews , and plus I fell in love with the battery pack compared to the Kodak , -LRB- I know I sound green -RRB- as well as a lot of other features .
p8891
aVReceived my Lumix on Wednesday , and right now , just playing around with it , reading the manual , and trying to familiarize myself with the camera .
p8892
aVNext week is my short work week , so I will get out there and take some pics and post some here .
p8893
aV: D
p8894
aa(lp8895
VThis camera seems to be a pretty good choice for someone new to digital photography .
p8896
aVThe price is reasonable and it has all the basic features .
p8897
aVIt is very easy to download pictures to the PC via the USB cable .
p8898
aVThe only complaint that I have so far -LRB- I have only had the camera for 1 week -RRB- is that the documentation is not user-friendly .
p8899
aVI had to call customer service to find out how to use the USB download .
p8900
aVTheir Customer Service Technician provided excellent support .
p8901
aVThe software instructions that come with the camera do not address the D-100 model download .
p8902
aVThey have added the instructions to their web site .
p8903
aVOverall I think this is a good choice for the `` novice '' that does n't want to spend a lot for a digital camera .
p8904
aa(lp8905
VIf you care more about the aesthetics , then the Flip MinoHD 2nd Gen. is hard to beat with its aluminum brush metal and USB flip-out switch , compared to the outside casing design , usually plastic , from other competitors .
p8906
aVHowever , if you care about more features and convenience , there 's better competition out there already , such as the Kodak and Creative .
p8907
aVIf you do heavy shooting , especially being on a trip where you wo n't have quick access to a laptop , you 'll definitely want an expandable memory and battery .
p8908
aVIf you want to shoot sports , you 'll definitely want a wider lens !
p8909
aVBoth of which , the Flip MinoHD lacks .
p8910
aVPros : ------------------------------------------ + Stylish .
p8911
aVAluminum .
p8912
aVSlim .
p8913
aV-LRB- it would go well with a Mac -RRB- + HD , although 1280x720 resolution , looks really great in bright , well-lit places -LRB- like most HD cameras -RRB- -- but do n't expect mind-blowing quality on a 50 '' TV from a pocket camera .
p8914
aVThis is good enough for sharing HQ video on YouTube and watching for its intended resolution or lower -LRB- not stretched\u005c/fit for bigger screens -RRB- + Recording Light\u005c/Startup sounds can be disabled -LRB- Thank you ! -RRB-
p8915
aV+ Turns on\u005c/off relatively quick + Actually shows a seekbar when playing back videos -LRB- for the Vado , it just shows the time -RRB- + USB flip out switch is pretty cool and somewhat addicting to press -LRB- however , this design is also a con because it would just hang on the USB ports with more strain than it should -RRB- + LCD screen has very vivid colors -LRB- more so than the actual recording -RRB- + Delete Lock Button\u005c/Protect videos , so you do n't accidentally delete things .
p8916
aV+ Tripod hole is centered -LRB- unlike with the Vado -RRB- Cons : ------------------------------------------ - Unswappable Internal battery -LRB- if it dies , you 're simply screwed !
p8917
aVlosing priceless video memories would be more devastating compared to simply losing music on an iPod , which could usually be more replaceable\u005c/redownloaded\u005c/usually have backup since you 're importing onto that device ; with these video cameras , you need to always have that ability to export it , not import your collection ! -RRB-
p8918
aV- Not Wide Lens - Touch-sensitive buttons can actually be more frustrating - may not always respond the way you like , especially holding on to the camera and touching to zoom in\u005c/out .
p8919
aV- The touch-sensitive buttons glow pretty bright , in addition to the LCD screen , so it causes too much attention shooting during concerts\u005c/dark rooms -LRB- wish the lights could be disabled -RRB- - Like most lower-end HD cameras , quality suffers and becomes less impressive with lower light -LRB- starts to see lots of noise unless you reduce the video size to 50 % -RRB- - Only one recording option 720p - 2x Digital Zoom -LRB- Not as awful as Creative Vado 's 2x digital zoom , but it 's still usually best to avoid as much as possible since you lose a lot of quality -RRB- - Personally had annoying issues where the LCD would temporarily leave a `` burn-in '' image of the battery icon right in the center of the screen -LRB- although the actual recording would be unaffected -RRB- - 90 Day Warranty -LRB- reliability is questionable , especially with picky internal batteries -RRB- - Does not come with USB extension cable -LRB- would be nice , since the USB adds some strain to most ports -RRB- or HDMI-mini cable .
p8920
aV-LRB- The Creative Vado 2nd Generation actually came with both accessories ! -RRB-
p8921
aV\u005c*\u005c*\u005c* Major Con : ------------------------------------------ - This device seems to REALLY rely on the state of the internal battery -- even when connecting to a computer\u005c/USB port that should be enough to power on the unit .
p8922
aVIf it 's completely out of juice , it wo n't even have the ability to realize , or at least tell you , that it has to start charging itself !
p8923
aVIt was quite a nightmare .
p8924
aVIt was only my third day having the Flip MinoHD , and it would not turn on at all after the screen had previously shown that it was too low on battery .
p8925
aVEven worse , I would connect it to my PC as usual -LRB- even tried it on a Mac -RRB- , but nothing detected !
p8926
aVThe screen was blank ; only the right side of the recording red LED indicator was lit ; when I removed it from my PC , the LED would stay stuck and still had no response to any of the buttons .
p8927
aVThe only way for that stuck LED to turn off was to reset it -LRB- there is a reset button pinhole under the tripod hole -RRB- .
p8928
aVHowever , that still did n't solve my problem and the LED would be stuck every time I connected to the USB .
p8929
aVAn advantage about having swappable battery , besides being able to shoot more , is if the unit ever freezes , you can usually take out the battery and put it back in to do a `` reset '' ; however , if it 's an internal battery like the Flip MinoHD , the only way to do so is by having a paper clip with you and sticking it into the pinhole .
p8930
aVIf the battery is faulty , the only way to fix would be to send it back to Cisco .
p8931
aVI also tried charging on a AC wall charger with USB , but it would n't charge at all because this device seems to require a communication on the USB data + \u005c/ - signal for it to actually charge .
p8932
aV------------------------------------------ FOR THE DEVICE TO ACTUALLY BE CHARGING PROPERLY : It should have BOTH red LEDs on the front -LRB- next to the lens -RRB- LIT and the back LCD screen should show a battery icon with a LIGHTNING BOLT flashing !
p8933
aV------------------------------------------ If you see only the right side of the LED lit or the LCD screen just shows a static battery icon , then it 's not really charging !
p8934
aVMost people , like me , at this point would assume their Flip MinoHD just turned into a brick !
p8935
aVI own other devices that charge via USB , and even when I completely run out of battery , the computer would at least recognize it right away because it would turn on by USB power and not wait for the internal battery to fill up a little first ; the Creative Vado -LRB- which has swappable lithium-ion battery -RRB- would still have the ability to power on just from the USB power alone -- even when I do n't even stick in a battery on the device !
p8936
aVI was really devastated because I could n't even retrieve my footage if I had to send it back to Cisco for a replacement .
p8937
aVI actually called Cisco and got a RMA and was about to send it back .
p8938
aVAfter all the talk on the phone and was about to fill out the RMA form , I actually tried one last luck of just keeping the device connected to my computer again ... it was blank and no response , but miraculously , both red LED on the front turned on and the device showed up on the computer !
p8939
aVThis is direct from Cisco 's page : ------------------------------------------ `` NOTE : You may see \u005c*\u005c*\u005c* no activity \u005c*\u005c*\u005c* on the camcorder - neither lights nor indication that the camcorder is charging - for the first 30 minutes .
p8940
aVOnce the initial 30 minutes has concluded , you should see some indication that the camcorder is charging and be able to power the camcorder on .
p8941
aVContinue charging for the full amount of time -LRB- we suggest three hours -RRB- to ensure that the battery is completely charged before recording again . ''
p8942
aV------------------------------------------ Well , is n't that nice to know ?
p8943
aVI mean seriously , most people would assume they have a brick unit if they do n't see any response\u005c/indication\u005c/connection on the computer for at least half an hour !
p8944
aVI really believe this is a major design flaw : that in cases where you end up running the battery too low , you 'll have to wait several minutes for the device battery to fill up a certain amount FIRST , before you could simply transfer the files off to the computer -- due to the unit heavily relying on the state of the internal battery , as opposed to the USB power going directly to the CPU hardware , so you could at least access the device from the get-go while it also begins to fill up the empty tank .
p8945
aVThe nice thing about removable memory , which the Flip MinoHD lacks , is even if the device fails , you can still transfer it off by simply getting any type of card reader .
p8946
aVI 'll have to remember to charge my FlipMino HD like I would fill up my car with gas before it runs empty to avoid greater headaches .
p8947
aVAlways try to unload footage immediately instead of keeping it on the device !
p8948
aVYou never know what would happen to it !
p8949
aV------------------------------------------ As stylish as this Flip MinoHD device is compared to all the pocket HD cameras out there , I still feel the Creative Vado is superior with having a wide lens -LRB- you have no idea how great it is to be able to capture a wider picture of everyone and surroundings -RRB- , better performance in low light , removable battery -LRB- also not picky when it comes to charging and detecting right away on the PC -RRB- , and the USB connection not putting as much strain on the USB ports -LRB- since it 's rubber -RRB- .
p8950
aVHowever , I do really like that the Flip gives an option of disabling the recording light and startup sounds !
p8951
aV-LRB- with the Vado , it is n't possible ... the startup\u005c/shutdown sound is annoying for it , especially when you need to film during a concert ! -RRB-
p8952
aV.
p8953
aVI feel the reliability of this device is n't quite there -LRB- and we know Flip previously also had a major USB connection size issue -RRB- ; I also had temporary issues when using the device after connected\u005c/charging for awhile , there would be `` burn-in '' image left of the battery icon on the LCD screen when shooting !
p8954
aVMoreover , when you look at the competition out there -LRB- such as the Kodak with expandable memory and 1080 -RRB- , it really is average underneath all the beauty of the casing .
p8955
aVThis device is probably suited more towards people who prefer aesthetics over features and do not do as much heavy shooting .
p8956
aVIf you 're the type who loves to shoot everything , you 'll want expandable battery and memory .
p8957
aVThe advantage of having removable memory is even if the device turns into a brick , you 'll have better chance of saving your priceless footage by just simply removing the SD card -LRB- or whatever card it uses -RRB- from the device .
p8958
aV------------------------------------------ The Flipshare software actually needs to be installed and not a software that can simply run off the device .
p8959
aVIt 's okay and nothing extraordinary .
p8960
aVOn the software , you can see thumbnails of the videos and play it back , but I wish the software would allow multiple video playback at once .
p8961
aVAlso when you play it full screen on the software , there is no seek bar !
p8962
aVAlso note , the sharing videos by email feature on the FlipShare software is not as private as you may think .
p8963
aVIt does not actually convert the video to an email file size for you , but instead it actually just uploads the video directly to Flip company 's ONLINE server where you and the email recipient will receive a `` private '' link to the video .
p8964
aVWho knows what 's going to happen to those videos .
p8965

VI got this camera on good deal of ~ 90 $ compared to market price of 179 $ .
p8967
aVCamera look and feel is nice .
p8968
aVIts small factor makes is easy to slide in your pocket .
p8969
aVThe new advanced auto feature is nice , i took the night shots inside the house in party and Its a BIG change\u005c/improvement from the IS780 -LRB- ~ 4yr old -RRB- .
p8970
aVI did n't select any mode and auto focus was able to capture the moments with good colors .
p8971
aVI have to say that I surely felt the lag time when using the flash , its ~ 2-3sec delay time before you can take the next photo .
p8972
aVI have n't tried the camera outside yet and I bet on the sunny day , it will take nice crisp photos .
p8973
aVI have n't any bad reviews yet for this model and for the price i paid for the camera even if there is noise @ higher ISO i do n't mind .
p8974
aVIt does n't have HDMI out , which i would have liked but still the video is of good quality .
p8975
aVIf you are looking for a point and shoot in the market , this is a good buy .
p8976

VThe Astak MOLE Camera is great for those who have trouble setting up highly technical equipment .
p8978
aVWe setup the MOLE using the included software and were up in running in about 10 minutes .
p8979
aVSearch for an APP called `` Live Cam '' if you are an iOS user and you will be able to use their great software to view as many cameras as you need to at once -LRB- think video surveillance -RRB- .
p8980
aVThere are likely a few better performing camera 's out there , but with the simplicity of installation and setup , I would suggest the MOLE to just about anyone looking for a way to remotely view a rooom or house .

VI bought the S9500 -LRB- Australia -RRB- about a month ago and am very dissapointed with it 's image quality .
p8983
aVNormal 6 '' x 4 '' prints were OK , but I was shocked when a friend at a camera shop took two images - one with the S9500 and one with a entry level DSLR and I saw the results .
p8984
aVHe had the prints enlarged to 8 '' x 12 '' and when I saw the results I knew I had really made the wrong decision in buying this camera !
p8985
aVThe image was soft and had quite noticeable grain even at ISO 100 !
p8986
aVWe compared the S9500 print with the DSLR print and there was no comparison at all .
p8987
aVThe print was sharper and grain free .
p8988
aVI bought this camera on Fuji 's claims of low noise , real photo technology etc. .
p8989
aVI am used to high image quality having owned a Nikon SLR film camera and expected better from this camera .
p8990
aVIt looks like a DSLR , feels like a DSLR and even has controls like a DSLR .
p8991
aVIt produces images though that any compact camera for half the price can produce .
p8992
aVIf you care anything about image quality -LRB- after all you may want to enlarge those special prints to 8 '' x 12 '' etc -RRB- do yourself a favor and buy an entry level DSLR .
p8993
aVI am taking this camera back to the shop and buying a Nikon D70s - a camera I know is capable of large , noise free prints .
p8994
aVI guess the ` Super CCD ' technology just ca n't make a small sensor as noise free as a large DLSR sensor despite the hype .
p8995
aVI will not be buying any Fuji products again - this experience has even turned me off their film .
p8996
aVI had a frustrating time trying to convince myself for nearly a month that it was me and not the cameras fault .
p8997
aVBut when you have a shop photographer with 30 years + experience fail to get good results from the S9500 then you know it is a failure .
p8998
aVHe even said that he said he expected much better results from it as they sell Fuji .
p8999
aVThe only positive things I can say is that its really looks like a real DLSR and uses AA batteries -LRB- which can be convenient -RRB- .
p9000
aVIt also has a ` reasonable ' build quality .
p9001
aVPlease make sure that if you do decide to buy this camera -LRB- it will suit some buyers -RRB- that you can return it for refund\u005c/exchange if not happy .
p9002
aVFuji really needs to be careful about their claims about this camera , on spec it looks absolutely fantastic !
p9003
aVPlease decide carefully and consider spending that bit extra for an entry level DSLR - you will not regret it !

VI had the junky Yashica before I purchased this Minolta .
p9006
aVThis Minolta is an excellent camera .
p9007
aVYou wo n't regret buying it .
p9008
aVThe film results were clear and crisp .
p9009
aVNo blurry prints with double faces showing-up like on the Yashica .
p9010
aVThis camera has features that work just as the instruction manual describes -LRB- pretty unusual for me -RRB- .
p9011
aVSimply awesome !
p9012
aa(lp9013
VBought it after a so so short term experience with SX30 which I returned to costco .
p9014
aVThis camera is far better than the other one .
p9015
aVThe major SX30 problems were focus and indoor pictures being yellow .
p9016
aVI was looking for a fully auto-for-dummies camera after my old Canon powershot died after many years .
p9017
aVIt had to have swivel screen .
p9018
aVI was hoping for a video recording camera too This Canon fulfills it all .
p9019
aVTHe indoor pix are great including without flash .
p9020
aVOf course not as sharp as the true SLRs since this is NOT an SLR despite its size .
p9021
aVThe zoom is excellent .
p9022
aVthe Video quality is excellent too as is its audio .
p9023
aVThe only down side is that if you take a picture while video'ing , the video will have a pause in it .
p9024
aVI am really impressed with this camera .
p9025
aVIf you are like me i.e. take pictures during trips or events and are total dummy as far as aperture and F numbers and that kind of stuff is concerned : you will like this camera .
p9026
aVFinally , the pictures come out just as good when viewed on a computer and when printed .
p9027
aa(lp9028
VI recently purchased the Panasonic HM-TA1 ... straight out of the box , I was immediately disappointed by the build quality - just seemed too `` delicate '' to be trotting around town with this thing in your pocket .
p9029
aVPicture quality is decent however .
p9030
aVA note to all : with any of these `` shoot n ' share '' cameras , please do n't expect picture quality to be like prosumer Sony 's HDV lineup or Panasonic 's HD P2 cameras ... and do n't compare these with HDSLR 's like Canon 's 7D and 5D MarkII .
p9031
aVIf you 're looking for that quality , then go buy those cameras .
p9032
aVSo a couple days later , I got turned on to Kodak 's lineup of these pocket HD camcorders -- and I saw the Playtouch .
p9033
aVLoved how they took the best of the Zi8 and incorporated it into a slick , sexy , touch-screen camcorder -LRB- like iPhones and Androids -RRB- .
p9034
aVI just had to get one !
p9035
aVSo I began my research -- skimming all over the internet reading customer 's reviews ... and well , even here on Amazon , they 're just not that flattering to Kodak 's Playtouch -- WOW , I was shocked - especially coming from such positive feedback with the Zi8 .
p9036
aVThe reviews are so negative , that I almost stopped right there .
p9037
aVSo I went into Best Buy to see what all the fuss was about -- instantly liked the feel and build quality much better than the Panasonic .
p9038
aVBut was still wondering if all these complaints I 've read are true -- horrible picture quality ... awful sound recording ... focusing issues , camera crashes , etc. .
p9039
aVWell , I guess the only way to find out was to bite the bullet and buy one .
p9040
aVSo I did .
p9041
aVThat was 9AM this morning .
p9042
aVIt is now 11:00 PM .
p9043
aVI 've played with this camera ALL DAY -- shot in all its recording formats , tested all the picture filters -LRB- which the `` 70s movie '' rocks ! -RRB-
p9044
aV-- even the internal mic is n't horrible -LRB- c'mon peeps , lets not be dramatic -RRB- ... the focusing and auto iris\u005c/exposure compensate very well and transitions smoothly in changing environments , my movies are all in focus and I had zero crashes .
p9045
aVThe big question : picture quality ?
p9046
aVListen folks , the picture quality is FINE , SUPER , DANDY .
p9047
aVAgain , do n't expect an HD Sony F900 picture result - but for these little portable cameras , this is probably even better than my Panasonic HM-TA1 .
p9048
aVI purchased this camera because I 'm getting into Vlogging .
p9049
aVThese cameras are perfect for that -LRB- pssst , that 's what they 're made for ... internet not broadcast quality -RRB- .
p9050
aVSmall , portable , easy to use .
p9051
aVThe Playtouch delivers on all fronts .
p9052
aVNow you can always get things to add and enhance your `` production value '' with these cameras .
p9053
aVFor instance , I purchased a small Sennheiser -LRB- MKE 400 -RRB- mini-shotgun mic -LRB- plugs directly into the Playtouch -RRB- .
p9054
aVReally improves the audio - a worthy investment .
p9055
aVAlso purchased a small `` Bracket '' , which is used to mount the shot gun mic and the camera .
p9056
aVBrackets are generally considered `` photography '' equipment , but it works perfectly for my set up plus it adds more `` stability '' to handheld shooting .
p9057
aVA great solution !
p9058
aVReally hope people will give this camera a chance .
p9059
aVI do n't understand all these negative reviews .
p9060
aVI 'm really happy with my purchase -- the user interface is great -- the touch screen is wonderfully responsive -- the picture quality is as good as it can be -LRB- for any of these pocket cameras -RRB- ... the audio is superb with the added shotgun mic ... all the video options and editing utilities work and look terrific .
p9061
aVWhat else can I say , I am a fan of Kodak 's Playtouch .
p9062
aVP.S. : I am a Mac user \u005c/ and this works seamlessly with my system -LRB- iMovie , iPhoto , etc. -RRB- .
p9063
aVEven did the firmware update : -RRB- And for those of you who are skeptics and wondering ... No , I do not work nor am affiliated with Kodak in any way , shape or form .
p9064
aVWhen I get some footage maybe I 'll share it here .
p9065
aVAfter all , a picture 's worth a thousand words .
p9066
aV: -RRB- \u005c*\u005c*\u005c* I really really wanted the red\u005c/orange version , but no one is carrying them !
p9067
aVI had no choice but to get the black version .
p9068
aVMaybe Kodak can send me a Red battery compartment : -RRB-
p9069
aa(lp9070
VI bought this for my teenage son 's girlfriend of 2 + years who loves snapping pictures and only had the camera on her cell phone .
p9071
aVThis takes AMAZING pictures and videos !
p9072
aVThe only drawback I saw was that there 's no slot for memory card ; only has internal 4GB of memory .
p9073
aVShe can take thousands of pictures though and quite a bit of video with that size memory and she 's transferred them onto her computer , then onto disk .
p9074
aVThe software is very user-friendly and she 's uploaded about a million pictures on her facebook page already .
p9075
aVI did buy an extra battery , car charger , and a case for it .
p9076
aVIt 's a little bigger than my Blackberry 8530 .
p9077
aVShe stuffs it in her pocket so I probably did n't need to buy the case but moms typically over-protect .
p9078
aV: -RRB- Could n't be more pleased with the entire purchase at Amazon and the product overall !
p9079
aa(lp9080

p9081

VHad an old Sony Cyber-shot for years and loved it .
p9084
aVDecided it was time to go smaller , lighter and get a better zoom .
p9085
aVTried 4 different brands looking for something to fit the bill and yet get photos that compared to the old sony .
p9086
aVSent back 4 cameras before I got the brillant idea to check out the new Sony , s. Of course I went to Amazon -LRB- as well as other places -RRB- and no one compares to the deals I get at Amazon .
p9087
aVSaved $ 200.00 and the service was great as usual .
p9088
aVCould not be happier with my new Sony Cyber-shot HX5V .
p9089
aVKeep it up Amazon !
p9090
aa(lp9091
VSony does it again ... ... .
p9092
aVAs an owner of many video cameras , I have experienced many cameras and have come back to the Sony DCR-DVD405 .
p9093
aVMy first digital DV camera was the Sony DCR-PC100 .
p9094
aVGreat camera , but a little dated .
p9095
aVBought the Panasonic DVD200 and it was terrible ... Then purchased the Sony DCR-DVD403 and was very impressed .
p9096
aVSo decided to go bigger and buy the Sony HD HC1 .
p9097
aVDisappointing to say the least especially since I spent $ 1700.00 dollars .
p9098
aVSo have now went back to the DVD405 and am done shopping .
p9099
aVGreat video , excellent Dolby sound , and pretty good battery life .
p9100
aVMedia is not so expensive when you buy in bulk -LRB- $ 0.48 -RRB- or buy a few DVD-RW -LRB- $ 5.00 \u005c/ Sony -RRB- .
p9101
aVAll my finalized DVD-R movies have played in all DVD players .
p9102
aVI always use the High Quality -LRB- HQ -RRB- to record and yes 20min does go fast , but worth the other positives .
p9103
aVDurability of the DVD403 was good so expect the DVD405 to be the same .
p9104
aVI like the look and the jack set-ups on the DVD405 better .
p9105
aVAlso the power button feels more secure .
p9106
aVSo take it from my experience and check out the Sony DCR-DVD405 .
p9107
aVWell worth the money , but I still suggest the extended warranty to off-set the unknown longevity of the operating system .
p9108
aVAny questions ... feel free to email me .

VI have never owned , nor have I ever looked into a telescope before , So this was my first time attempting to operate one .
p9111
aVIt was GREAT !!
p9112
aVI had to learn how to use the lenses , but once I did , I was in such awe of how clear this Telescope showed the moon .
p9113
aVBut not just the clarity , but the detail I could see on the surface !
p9114
aVMy 14 year old son , who was also able use this scope with ease was in amazement of how good this instrument worked !
p9115
aVI read the reviews first , and weighed the options , and am so happy , that I did n't listen to the negative comments about this particular Telescope , and concentrated on the good ones , because they were correct !
p9116
aVI consider this purchase a steal , because I 'm not easily wowed , and this thing WOWED me !!
p9117
aVI think this a GREAT starter telescope , because it is inexpensive , but the end results , and the experience is priceless , and will not disappoint you !
p9118
aa(lp9119
VI installed this screen protector in a matter of seconds without any bubbles .
p9120
aVIt 's virtually invisible , and seems quite durable .
p9121
aVFor the price , it ca n't be beat .
p9122
aVFor those having application problems , I have noticed that it really helps when applying protectors to wipe the screen down with a tiny bit of glass cleaner applied to the cloth , NOT directly to the screen itself .
p9123
aVThis seems to help with air bubbles that may be caused from dust\u005c/small hair or fuzz still stuck to the screen .
p9124
aa(lp9125
VOkay , I tested all the 8MP out there and so far this is the one I have to say is the best .
p9126
aVIt is a little bit harder to get used too , but believe me .
p9127
aVOnce you get the hang of it , there is no going wrong .
p9128
aVI do recommend getting the fastest memory card there is .
p9129
aVI am shooting `` raw images '' and the faster the card the faster you get the picture .
p9130
aVIt is a NIKON .

VI bought this telescope for my girlfriend for Christmas .
p9133
aVShe had been wanting a telescope for sometime so I decided this would be the perfect gift .
p9134
aVI was looking for a scope that would n't break the bank but would n't be a piece of junk either .
p9135
aVI looked at models from Meade and Celestron but ultimately decided on this one .
p9136
aVI chose this over the refractor telescopes mainly because it seemed that to look into the refractor scopes would require a lot of bending over whereas this one has the eyepiece closer to eye level which makes viewing easier .
p9137
aVAlso , go for the equatorial mount , it 's much easier to track things in the sky using it as we quickly found out .
p9138
aVOk , so how was it ?
p9139
aVWell it came in a big box -LRB- which made the g\u005c/f crazy with this HUGE gift under the tree ! -RRB-
p9140
aVand everything was nicely and neatly packed .
p9141
aVEverything appeard to be of high quality and good build ; which is typical of Orion products from what I 've read .
p9142
aVThe instruction maunal on assemble was pretty scarce .
p9143
aVAnyone who 's pretty handy at building things will be able to figure it out ; but it 's not the easiest thing either .
p9144
aVThis is mainly because of a lack of pictures to go along with the assembly steps .
p9145
aVWell we got it assembled and waited for dark .
p9146
aVIt was pretty cold and we just did some viewing of the moon and a couple of stars from the front yard .
p9147
aVA hazy night with tons of light from the street did n't provide the best viewing conditions .
p9148
aVThat being said the moon looked amazing !!
p9149
aVThe detail was outstanding .
p9150
aVWe were able to also see the Orion Nebula and looked at other stars .
p9151
aVI ca n't even imagine what it will look like on a good clear night .
p9152
aVWe 're looking foward to bringing it camping with us where there will be some great viewing .
p9153
aVThe included software is also extremely useful and fun to use .
p9154
aVThe software alone is easily worth more than half of the price of this scope .
p9155
aVEven if you hate the scope ; you can learn a lot of great information from the software .
p9156
aVOverall this is a great scope for the amateur astronomer .
p9157
aVIt 's cheap enough that it wo n't break the bank -LRB- good especially if you 're not sure if astronomy is for you -RRB- but still plenty good enough for some great viewing .
p9158
aVThe instruction manual could be better but the quality of the software and of the scope itself more than makes up for the poor manual .
p9159
aVI would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone looking for a good budget scope !
p9160
aV\u005c* Update \u005c* We 've had this scope for about 16 months now , and it 's fantastic !!
p9161
aVWe have taken it with us several places camping and have gotten to see some really great stuff .
p9162
aVIt 's fairly easy to find the planets and even a galaxy or two .
p9163
aVThe only downside is that it takes up a lot of room in the car when we camp ; but this would be true for any decent telescope .
p9164
aVSo not so much a problem with this one specifically , but with telescopes in general .
p9165
aVEven to this day , we 're still amazed just looking at the moon .
p9166
aVThe details and `` awesomeness '' of it never get old .
p9167
aVReally looking at everything never gets old .
p9168
aVI 'm so glad we have this scope !
p9169
aV\u005c* December 2010 Update \u005c* I thought I would give an additional update .
p9170
aVWe have had this telescope for 4 years now .
p9171
aVIt 's fantastic .
p9172
aVAbsolutely fantastic .
p9173
aVI can not recommend it enough .
p9174
aVRecently we were looking at Jupiter and could make out all of the Galilean moons as well as being able to make out red striping of the planet itself -LRB- still have n't been able to see the great spot ! -RRB-
p9175
aV.
p9176
aVAll of this from the front of our yard in the city .
p9177
aVA buddy of mine got a 7 '' reflector scope , and while his can see much deeper and give better resolution , this one is still tops in my book .
p9178
aVIt 's easy to transport and move around and still provides great viewing .
p9179
aVWe just love taking it camping with us - get 50 miles out of the city and the `` awe factor '' grows exponentially .
p9180
aVTry taking a huge super powerful scope camping , or seeing anything cool with one of the cheap toy-store ones .
p9181
aVFor price and features , you ca n't beat this one .
p9182
aa(lp9183
VFor the product and technical illiterate , this is a great camera .
p9184
aVFor those who know a little bit more , it is an excellent camera .
p9185
aVEasy to set up , use and edit .
p9186
aVPlacing the dvd directly into the camera is the best !
p9187
aVFinalise it , and walk right over to the DVD player ... Awesome !
p9188
aa(lp9189
VThis is an amazing little camera .
p9190
aVThe size is not really a pocket size as it is big and heavy for a shirt pocket .
p9191
aVThe video is nice , smooth and very good quality .
p9192
aVThe pictures it took is excellent .
p9193
aVThe little built flash amazes me , more than adequate .
p9194
aVI thought it would focus faster in low light , but then I was comparing it with my Canon 50D .
p9195
aVI bought this to supplement photoshoots when I do n't want to changes lens and need something fast .
p9196
aa(lp9197
VWe like the Flip .
p9198
aVBut , our camera 's video is almost as good .
p9199
aVI 'd suggest saving the 200 and buying a good camera\u005c/camcorder combo .
p9200
aVOne less device to deal with .
p9201
aa(lp9202
VBought this for my son who broke his last camera that had a screen that flips out .
p9203
aVThis does not have that part to worry about .
p9204
aVTakes good pics and is easy to use .
p9205
aVAlso loves the tripod .
p9206
aVHave n't tested the waterproof part yet .
p9207
aa(lp9208
Vwhat a JOKE !
p9209
aVI bought this reconditioned and was totally disappointed in the picture quality - which was WORSE than my old standard def DV camcorder !
p9210
aVI thought it might be a reconditioning issue .
p9211
aVWHen I discussed the issue with Kodak support they informed it that it is 1080p ... UNLESS you zoom in - then it no longer is !
p9212
aVWHAT A JOKE !
p9213
aVdo n't buy the 1080p ` full def ' crap .
p9214
aVIf you are looking for a very portable , moderately decent camera - this will do .
p9215
aVIt would be good for Youtube videos - but if you are looking for a camera to record family memories to play back on your HD TV ... keep looking .
p9216
aVI will not be buying Kodak again

VI received the Nikon P100 for my birthday in mid March .
p9219
aVIt is the first Nikon camera I have ever owned .
p9220
aVIn the 5 months I have owned the P100 , it has been in Nikon service for 2 OF THOSE MONTHS .
p9221
aVEach time Nikon had my camera for repairs , they replaced a whole list of parts and both times I received the camera back in far worse condition .
p9222
aVThe more they work on it and replace parts the worse it gets .
p9223
aVAnd for some reason they keep sending it back to me with more and more problems and issues .
p9224
aVUnbelievable .
p9225
aVAfter spending another 2 hours on the phone with Nikon Tech Support , I was told the camera had to be sent back again .
p9226
aVSo , for the THIRD TIME , I sent the camera to them .
p9227
aVI was told they would let me know if they decide to replace it or try to fix it again .
p9228
aVSeriously .
p9229
aVMy response to this statement was that if they COULD fix it then they WOULD have .
p9230
aVIt was n't fair to ask me to wait while they tried to fix it for the THIRD TIME .
p9231
aVThey need to just replace it with a new camera .
p9232
aVIn the meantime , I was asked to send a few of the pictures for Nikon to analyze .
p9233
aVThe response I received from a Nikon supervisor said that the pictures I sent were bad because of the settings used and the composition .
p9234
aVFor the glare problem , he instructed me NOT to face toward the sun when taking pictures .
p9235
aVHe also suggested a setting to use for indoor low light conditions and asked me to try that and let him know how it works .
p9236
aVHow insulting !
p9237
aVWow .
p9238
aVNikon is blaming me for all the picture and camera problems and not taking any responsibility for the fact that in the 8 weeks they have had my camera for repairs they were never able to fix it - and , in fact , made it worse and still sent it back to me like there was no problem .
p9239
aVAnd I ca n't very well try a different setting on a camera that I do not have - and this Nikon supervisor knew that the camera had been sent back .
p9240
aVWhen is Nikon going to take responsibility for their product and stand behind it ?
p9241
aVThey need to accept the fact that I just happened to get the one bad apple in the bunch .
p9242
aVI 've already gone 8 weeks -LRB- and counting -RRB- without the use of my camera .
p9243
aVThey 've already had 2 chances to fix it and they have n't .
p9244
aVThey need to replace it with a new camera before the last shred of respect - and confidence - I have for Nikon is gone .
p9245
aVThis is n't exactly how I thought my first experience with a Nikon camera would turn out .
p9246
aVNot a fan of the camera , Nikon , tech support , or their service department now .
p9247
aa(lp9248
VI 'm a serious amateur who has used the D70s for nearly three years for paid gigs and personal use .
p9249
aVFocusing and frame rate are fast enough for nearly every event I 've ever been to .
p9250
aVPhotojournalists will be pleased , but sport shooters may want to look for another option .
p9251
aVdo n't let the lower MP count scare you away from this little gem ; prints enlarge just fine up to 11X14 -LRB- I do n't usually print larger than that -RRB- .
p9252
aVBattery life on the D70s leaves nothing to be wanted .
p9253
aVI 've shot almost all day on one charge .
p9254
aVif you bring a spare battery , you 'll have no worries .
p9255
aVThe LCD is on the smaller side , but its adequate for checking exposure , and you can also detect any camera shake .
p9256
aVNo complaints .
p9257
aVThe menu system is very straightforward and easy to use .
p9258
aVControls on the camera body are placed within easy reach and you can change most settings without removing your eye from the viewfinder -- a big plus .
p9259
aVMetering is usually very good , but sometimes I 've had to use compensation to nail exposure .
p9260
aVsome people make this out to be a huge problem , but it really is n't .
p9261
aVjust know enough about your camera to make it do what you want it to do under any lighting conditions .
p9262
aVI gave the D70s a four instead of five because after a couple years of use , the built-in flash seems to be dying an early death .
p9263
aVIt does n't fire all the time anymore .
p9264
aVNot a huge problem if you use speedlights attached to the body , but it has become a problem in the nikon creative lighting system , which is one of the reasons I wanted the camera .
p9265
aVAll in all , a wonderful camera to use .
p9266
aVits well-built , allows for full creative control , keeps up at most events and allows for full use of nikon lenses .
p9267
aa(lp9268
VDecent non professional home movie quality ... all one can expect for the price which is low .
p9269
aVHavent tried the still component yet .
p9270
aVGood zoom capacity , not so good low light capacity .
p9271
aa(lp9272
VIf you want your face to look grainy in pictures , well , then , you might as well just buy this camera .
p9273
aVThe resolution is very bad -LRB- TERRIBLE ! -RRB-
p9274
aV, even on high quality .
p9275
aVPros : Very handy paperweight , Fun to play catch with , Nice looking , And also functions as a very fun pool toy !
p9276
aVCons : Terrible resolution , Wo n't work with green-screens , Wo n't get you anywhere in life , makes you angry , and you 'll want to return it .
p9277
aVBuy at your own risk .
p9278
aV\u005c* THE RESULTS ARE THE SAME FOR ALL CAMERAS OF THIS TYPE , I RETURNED MY FIRST ONE AND GOT A NEW ONE , BUT FACED THE SAME PROBLEMS \u005c*
p9279
aa(lp9280
VThis is a great camera for those of us that do n't know a whole lot about photography .
p9281
aVThe instructions and controls are easy to follow to make great photos .
p9282
aVIt does much more than I have experimented with yet but I know it will be fun and easy to try new things .
p9283
aa(lp9284
VThe f\u005c/1 .8 lens is one of this camera 's best assets .
p9285
aVIt has allowed me to get shots in low light or of moving subjects that were impossible with my previous point and shoot .
p9286
aVErgonomics are pretty good , with the exception of the macro function .
p9287
aVBettery life is sufficient for my use and comparable to my previous lumix .
p9288
aVThe camera generally does a good job picking exposure and white balance .
p9289
aVThe only things I do not really care for are the in-camera battery charging , and the use of a lens cap .
p9290
aVBoth are addressable with accessories , but portability suffers a little .
p9291
aVColors are a little too saturated on the OLED display , but the latter is fairly bright and usable in almost any lighting conditions .
p9292
aa(lp9293
VTHIS PRODUCT IS GOOD FOR SEEING STARS AT NIGHT , BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SEEING COMETS OR MARS MOVING CLOSER TO EARTH .
p9294
aVIT CAN BE A PAIN BECAUSE IT WONT BE ABLE TO GET TO THAT RANGE !!!
p9295
aVIF YOU WANT TO SEE SHOOTING STARS THIS CAN BE THE PRODUCT FOR YOUR .
p9296
aVBUT IF YOU WANT TO SEE OUR MOST OF THE STUFF IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM , THEN GET YOURSELF A MORE ADVANCE SCOPE LIKE THE COMPUTER GENERATED MODELS .

VMy wife and I have gone through 3 , this being our third one , cameras in less than 4 years .
p9299
aVMind you we take excellent care of our cameras , but still with no warning ... BAM ... they just stopped working .
p9300
aVWe had always been faithful to Samsung because we loved our very first `` real '' digital camera which was a Samsung .
p9301
aVHowever after two failures we decided to abandon ship and try a brand with more Camera behind its name .
p9302
aVAfter shopping around I found this Canon Powershot at a very good price .
p9303
aVSo far so good .
p9304
aVEasy to use ... not quite as easy as our Samsungs , great picture quality and all the features and specs we were looking for .
p9305
aVI have had some trouble taking video in low light ... very grainy !!
p9306
aVThe only other thing that I am not super happy about is the flash sensitivity in easy mode .
p9307
aVThere are times where it seems like there would be no need for flash and yet POOF ... which we all know can create a lot of flash back and consequently a poorer quality shot .
p9308
aVOverall I am very pleased .
p9309
aVIt has a quick focus\u005c/shutter speed which has made for some great action shots ... it 's a bit slow between pics , but not much more than most .
p9310
aVFor the price I got at Amazon for this camera ... I ca n't complain .
p9311
aVIf you have the money ... buy a more expensive , more professional type camera -LRB- like SLR -RRB- to avoid those little annoying quirks .
p9312
aVIf you are like me and riding a shoestring budget ... shop Amazon for Canon and you will be satisfied overall .
p9313
aa(lp9314
VBefore purchasing , I did a lot of research comparing the Kodak PlaySport and the Flip UltraHD cameras .
p9315
aVI decided to go with the PlaySport for the following features : Higher Resolution : PlaySport does 1080p \u005c* and \u005c* 720p at 60fps .
p9316
aVFlip does 720p at 60fps , but wo n't go higher than 720p .
p9317
aVWaterproof : Seemed like a cool feature , even though I never used it underwater .
p9318
aVFlexible Storage : With the PlaySport , I choose the size of the Flash Memory Card I want to use .
p9319
aVI can also swap out cards if one card fills up -LRB- assuming I own more than one Flash Memory Card -RRB- .
p9320
aVWith the Flip , I 'm stuck with the predetermined 8GB that I have to dump onto a hard drive once it fills up .
p9321
aVImage Manipulation Options : Kodak offers fun stuff like ` black and white ' and ` super saturation ' modes .
p9322
aVFun , but relatively useless .
p9323
aVHaving owned and traveled with the Kodak PlaySport for several months now , here 's my basic assessment of the camera : STRENGTHS -LRB- in no particular order -RRB- : - Compact -- fits in the front pocket of my jeans , along with my cell phone .
p9324
aV- Rugged -- in and out of my front pocket , jostled around with my cell phone , and still not a scratch .
p9325
aV- 16GB Flash Memory Card holds nearly 3 hours of video shot at 1080P - Waterproof , means I do n't have to worry about shooting in tropical rainstorms , or in Southeast Asian swamps - Looks like a cell phone , so if you hold it up to your ear and pretend to have a conversation , you can record stuff without being noticed .
p9326
aV: -RRB- Plus , people seem to think that it looks cool .
p9327
aV- USB cord is compact and comes with an adapter that can conveniently be plugged into the wall .
p9328
aV- Decent performance in low-light situations -LRB- shot some cool footage in a club that turned out pretty well -- a little grainy , but that 's to be expected -RRB- - Clear , sharp video in daylight -LRB- sunny as well as rainy -RRB- conditions WEAKNESSES and ANNOYANCES -LRB- in no particular order -RRB- : - Focus -- for anything within 3 feet of the camera , forget about being in focus .
p9329
aVI was trying film an object on the ground and was holding the camera waist-high .
p9330
aVThe picture quality was so out-of-focus it was unuseable .
p9331
aV- Lens seems a little `` tight . ''
p9332
aVIn other words , the image that you capture tends to be a little closer than your naked eye .
p9333
aVSo to shoot something the way your eye sees it , you usually have to move back a few steps .
p9334
aVFor general point-and-shoots like the PlaySport , I prefer slightly `` wider '' lenses .
p9335
aV- Camera takes a few seconds to acknowledge that it 's recording .
p9336
aVThis is crucial when you 're trying to shoot something that happens quickly in the heat of the moment .
p9337
aVYou hit the record button and nothing happens , so you hit it again and turn off recording without realizing it .
p9338
aVBy the time you 've figured out what 's happened , the event you wanted to shoot is already over .
p9339
aV- In the same vein , the navigator wheel and buttons are a little stiff and unresponsive .
p9340
aVScrolling through your clips or fast forwarding through them may require a couple of button presses before the camera actually does what you want it to .
p9341
aV- Clips sometimes are stored out of order .
p9342
aVSay you shot something last night , but when you look for it , once in a while you have to scroll through to footage you shot 2 months ago to find it .
p9343
aV- The remote control -LRB- sold separately -RRB- barely works and you literally have to be within 3 ft of the camera to get it to work reliably .
p9344
aV- Without the image stabilization turned on , the video is noticeably jittery on a large screen -LRB- I noted it on my 42 '' flat screen -RRB- .
p9345
aVAs everyone else says , the Kodak PlaySport is an okay camera for the price .
p9346
aVFor me , however , if it were n't for the PlaySport 's HD functionality , I 'd still rather shoot short video clips on my 640x480 digital camera for the more flexible lens , the better auto-focus , and the ability to adjust exposure .
p9347
aa(lp9348
Vthis camera is so fun yet simple , the colored flash gives you so many options and i love it .
p9349
aVits well worth the $ 70 .
p9350
aVi also love the long exposure feature the results look great .
p9351
aVi definetly recommend this camera over some of the other lomography cameras because its so versitle .
p9352
aa(lp9353
VThis camera is excellent .
p9354
aVIt makes HD video and this is great .
p9355
aVWell done and it worth money .
p9356
aVThe only problem is that battery runs out quickly .
p9357
aa(lp9358
VThe quality of this camera is great for someone like me .
p9359
aVI am an amateur video maker and I wanted something thats full HD and good but not something above 550 $ .
p9360
aVThis is perfect inside , it reduces the grainy to almost unnoticeable , that is when there is not much light too .
p9361
aVFor outdoors it is absolutly wonderful !
p9362
aV-LRB- Almost every camera is but still -RRB- I love it .
p9363
aa(lp9364
VLa verdad , me parece una excelente camara a un precio muy accesible .
p9365
aVAltamente recomendada para quien como yo , no es un fotografo profesional , pero gusta de hacer fotos decorosas .
p9366
aVAdemas , es Sony .
p9367
aVLa recomiendo a ojos cerrados .
p9368
aa(lp9369
VI bought this IP camera as a baby monitor to assuage my wife 's fears for our daughter sleeping in her crib .
p9370
aV-LRB- The standing on the side of the crib made her nervous -RRB- .
p9371
aVThe setup for this device was very simple .
p9372
aVThe included directions , while slightly grammatically incorrect , were easy to follow and accurate .
p9373
aVThe setup took about 10 minutes to get going on LAN , and then only a few minutes more to get the Wireless mode working .
p9374
aVThe camera is working great with WPA2 -LRB- AES -RRB- enabled , so no need to sacrifice security to have a camera .
p9375
aVThe quality of the video is n't the greatest , but I did n't buy this to have stunning HD video , I bought it to get a general idea what is going on .
p9376
aVThe day mode has good fps as well .
p9377
aVThe night vision mode surprised me with the clarity and what I can see .
p9378
aVAgain , it is n't the highest quality , but it is very easy to see what is going on .
p9379
aVYou lose some fps , but you can still easily see what is going on .
p9380
aVOverall , I highly recommend this camera , and I am considering purchasing more for purposes of security \u005c/ home monitoring .
p9381
aVI have yet to configure remote viewing -LRB- via internet -RRB- , but that 's a lower priority since the primary purpose was as a video baby monitor .
p9382
aVHowever , the included directions are very clear how to enable to functionality .
p9383
aa(lp9384
VAs a new user of digital cameras , I bought this unit kinda on a whim .
p9385
aVI 'd purchased its 35mm film-based cousin last month and when my wife 's Minolta point-and-shoot started acting up , I figured it was time for an upgrade ; and since most of my former camera work was done with 35mm SLRs with real glass lenses , I opted for something that looked familiar .
p9386
aVOnly after I bought the Rebel did I find out that it was a fairly well-rated camera .
p9387
aVTwo things that caught me off guard : 1 -RRB- it does n't come with a memory card , and 2 -RRB- it does n't support video recording .
p9388
aVNeither of these are deal breakers , but for a $ 500 camera a $ 1 memory card should have been in included .
p9389
aVAnd the non-video capture ability just surprises me as I see this feature in lower priced units .
p9390
aVI 'll update this review after spending some time using the camera .
p9391
aa(lp9392
VI bought this camera for my 17 year old son to take on a three week trip to South Africa for FIFA World Cup soccer .
p9393
aVHe did n't want one too big or heavy , it had to fit in his pocket -LRB- big pants -RRB- .
p9394
aVI could n't believe the pictures he took with it ; he has pictures of players on the field at the games just like I saw on ESPN.com they were so close up .
p9395
aVAnd one of the coach that was on the opposite side of the field from him , unbelievable .
p9396
aVThe zoom is a 10x , but it can go up to 40x and the pictures are still great .
p9397
aVHe took some pictures of a giraffe from a safari that he said was a football field and a half away and it looks as though it 's right outside the vehicle .
p9398
aVThe screen is very clear and good size .
p9399
aVWhen you change the settings it tells you what you have changed it to on the screen , no looking back at the manual each time .
p9400
aVI would recommend this camera to everyone , oh wait I already have .
p9401
aa(lp9402
VFor years I have been looking for a camera that would allow me to have all the features in a small package .
p9403
aV.
p9404
aVISO , Exp control , Diafragm , WB control , Bracketing , AF lock ... I think I found what I was looking for !!
p9405
aValso , controls are very easy to reach , plus , you can have your own custom menu , There are plenty of tools and features that even learners would appreciate , Grid , horizon level , histogram ... anyway , the LCD is wide enough and sharp , Overall , I feel this is the best toy I ever had from Nikon .
p9406
aVThanks
p9407
aa(lp9408
VMy canon 1d mark4 is a good camera but shows slight noise at above 1500 iso .
p9409
aVThe nikon is perfect up to about 4000 .
p9410
aVFor anyone needing low light ability , this is the best camera on the market at any price .
p9411
aa(lp9412
VI now have several of these cameras at both of our homes .
p9413
aVI previously used Panasonic but these cameras work flawlessly and the iPhone app is terrific .
p9414
aVYou wo n't be disappointed with this camera in any way .
p9415
aVIt is easy to install and works amazing in the dark .
p9416
aa(lp9417
VI am happy with this cam because of it 's ease of use and the additional features .
p9418
aVIt works as well as a higher price Canon I used to have minus some features like a remote control .
p9419
aVOf course , I am simply interested in capturing the action and am not concerned about making a high quality movie .
p9420
aa(lp9421
VLeica M9 , absolutely unique in all the world , image quality is super amazing , very solid piece of art with ease of use .
p9422
aVCompact , Discreet , Focused and Though , I love it .
p9423
aVThanks Amazon for the fast delivery .
p9424
aVI sold my M9 after 3 months of use , got nikon d700 with nikon 17-35mm f\u005c/2 .8 , I 'm glad I did it , you ca n't miss a moment with nikon d700 but with the m9 you will ,

VThis little viewer enabled me to sort hundreds of slides to get them ready to put on a CD .
p9427
aVIt worked just fine , was inexpensive and made the job a snap .
p9428
aVI very much recommend it for anyone with a lot to sort who does n't want to spend a lot of money doing it .
p9429
aVAlso it was simple to operate and use .
p9430
aVPut two AA batteries in it and you are ready to go .
p9431
aVI probably sorted a thousand slides and it 's still going strong .
p9432
aa(lp9433
VThe problem with this camera is the pictures !
p9434
aVAnd after all is said and done what else do you really care about ?
p9435
aVI bought this camera for my wife who is an avid amateur family photographer .
p9436
aVShe wanted something which would take a great quality photo of the things going on around her .
p9437
aVThere are plenty of super-portable , feature loaded minis to choose from these days .
p9438
aVAny one of them can take a decent snap shot .
p9439
aVFrom there , this camera is a big step up in price and a big step down in portability .
p9440
aVThe promise is that with all it 's quality craftsmanship and high tech features you will get real bang for your buck in picture quality .
p9441
aVSorry folks , it just is not the case .
p9442
aVSet to full automatic - where all the bells and whistles should really show their stuff - this camera regularly overexposes ordinary daylight photos .
p9443
aVIt routinely washes out indoor shots with its own flash .
p9444
aVAnd the auto focus is nothing to brag about .
p9445
aVMy wife is not a photographer .
p9446
aVShe is an ordinary person who wanted to have fun taking really good family photos .
p9447
aVThis camera was a huge let down .
p9448
aa(lp9449
VI have owned my 828 about a year now and I have been amazed at the bashing this camera has and still does take .
p9450
aVEven to the point of 828 online clubs devoted to the pictures and defense of this amazing camera !
p9451
aVAnd yes this camera is amazing .
p9452
aVAs I have stated in my other reviews I sell cameras for BestBuy as well as work as a professional photographer so I will give you the straight and narrow on this camera .
p9453
aVReady ?
p9454
aVThe fringe thing-I have taken about 2000 pictures with my 828 and in only one of them was I able to reproduce the famed purple fringing effect , this was using a long shutter exsposure on a city street at night , 1999 other shots in as many situations and not a trace .
p9455
aVI even tried pointing the camera directly at the lights in the the bestbuy store -LRB- you know what those look like ! -RRB-
p9456
aVand guess what ?
p9457
aV`` Nada '' I just got a great picture of the bestbuy ceiling .
p9458
aVSo the conclusion on fringe ?
p9459
aVGet over it , it is such a rare occurance that it hardly warrants concearn .
p9460
aVNoise : here is where a tend to agree with most critics your pics will get mad noisy at the 800 ISO setting , but few digital cameras wont , hell even Canon 's 20D starts losing luster at a 800 ISO setting and that camera will go all the way upto 3200 !!
p9461
aVSo turn down the ISO and take your pictures or learn to use photoshop or something and fix them .
p9462
aVI mean this is a DIGITAL camera right ?
p9463
aVThe thing these bozos do n't tell you is that removing ISO noise from an image is an extremely easy thing to do , again , get over it .
p9464
aVHaving addressed the two main gripes about the 828 what are you left with ?
p9465
aVLets start with the four color CCD .
p9466
aVI have said this before and I 'm saying it now : The 828 has the best color of ANY digital camera out there today !
p9467
aVIf your into outdoor pics , close ups , night shots -LRB- turn that ISO down -RRB- your pictures and thier color will be amazing !
p9468
aVBy the way touching on low light pics and the 828 , I do alot of long exsposure shots with the 828 and they are always top notch !
p9469
aVBattery life on the 828 is an impressive 240-300 minutes on a full charge !
p9470
aV-LRB- no kidding -RRB- The Lense - the biggest part of the camera and the biggest attraction if you like focusing your camera yourself -LRB- with a little digital help -RRB- .
p9471
aVThe lense is a Ziess made with little to no barrel distortion -LRB- flower lense hood is included !
p9472
aVBONUS !! -RRB-
p9473
aVand quite versitile as far as the focal ranges it will cover , this also brings me to the cameras construction , this baby is heavy but damn !
p9474
aVit sure feels good !
p9475
aVThe 828 is the 2nd largest in its class , so if your into pocket toys you best be looking at Casio or HP cameras -LRB- sorry that was mean -RRB- The 828 is really a SLR camera with a lense on it you ca n't take off .
p9476
aVEnd of story .
p9477
aVThe body reminds me of my Sony F-707 wich I loved -LRB- probably the best 5MP camera ever made -RRB- The tilting body is a Godsend for the pro and joe shmoe alike !
p9478
aVThe eye piece is among the best out there and id diopter adjustable , the LCD screen is a little small 1.8 inches but is extrememly clear and sharp so it works for me .
p9479
aVThe 828 like its little brother the V3 shoots on Memory stick as well as Compact flash type I  II , and unlike the V3 the 828 can use micro-drives -LRB- I have a 4 gig in mine -RRB- All the controls on the camera are well placed and easy to master even for the beginner .
p9480
aVHowever I found i got slightly better pictures in the `` P '' mode than in full auto , but a novice should always start in the auto mode .
p9481
aVThe 828 boasts the same range of shutter speeds and apatures as the DSC-V3 -LRB- see my review -RRB- wich as I have said before I think is a sane selection of ranges !
p9482
aVAll your options are useable so play , play , play !!
p9483
aVThe scene modes are pretty run of the mill : Landscape , night shot , low light portrait , snow , tropical sun , and candle light .
p9484
aVThe white balancing features are pretty dead bang but watch out for the blues - I leave mine set to auto unless im shooting outside then I 'm pretty safe .
p9485
aVSonys X-32 flash and this camera are a match made in heaven but thanks to the ACC port your old one will work too , but I ca n't stress enough the benefit of Sony 's .
p9486
aVSony still has the on board crop feature .
p9487
aV-LRB- other cameras do this but only Sony lets you determine the resolution of the cropped image !
p9488
aVI have just barely touched on the features and capabilities of this camera -LRB- I do n't want to use up all of amazons web space -RRB- so let me leave you with these thoughts .
p9489
aVCurrently I own and run the following digital cameras : F-828 , DSC-V3 , Nikon 8700 , and the Nikon 8800 , all four of these are eceptionally high rated cameras , out of all the 828 remains my right hand camera .
p9490
aVI will say in all honestly this is not an easy camera to use , It will make you think about your shots , make you work for them .
p9491
aVThis is NOT a point and shoot camera , it was never meant to be -LRB- people who love this camera will tell you this -RRB- So why all the bad press ?
p9492
aVWell , with this camera Sony made an awful lot of professionals toys run of the mill , this camera broke down alot of technology barriers -LRB- still does in fact -RRB- So alot of people went on the offensive looking for the fly in the ointment , wich can be found with any camera on the market today .
p9493
aVSo why the fuss ?
p9494
aVthis is a genuine technology breakthru people , the real deal , and there ai n't no going back .
p9495
aVI apologize for the lack of technical data in this review I love this damn camera so much I tend to spend more time defending it than specing it out !
p9496
aVBut the proof is in the pictures so with that I 'll rest my case .
p9497
aVBecause the strongest feature of the 828 is the most important one `` the pictures are fantastic !! ''
p9498
aVIf you want an easy to use camera , move on .
p9499
aVIf you like to fuss with things and tinker or play with your camera , have fun with your camera , create with your camera then add this puppy to your shopping cart .
p9500
aVcause this is your beast .
p9501
aVI have heard Sony is working on a successor to the 828 I can only hope it is half the camera !
p9502
aVBottom line ... do n't believe the hype or sour grapes folks this is the state-of-the art and has been for nearly 2 years .
p9503
aVThanks for reading , good luck in pictures !!
p9504
aa(lp9505
VI have been working for a major daily newspaper in Baltimore for 2 decades .
p9506
aVPerhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography .
p9507
aVI have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s .
p9508
aVMaybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography .
p9509
aVThis may be long - winded , but it 's extensive and can be useful .
p9510
aVI received the Nikon D2H camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago .
p9511
aVI think I got them shortly after the D2H system was released in 2003 .
p9512
aVSince then , I have used them to shoot images of all types -- documentary , sports , daytime , available light , flash , and dead - of - night -- for the paper I work for .
p9513
aVThis is the only camera I work with .
p9514
aVFirst , please read the manual .
p9515
aVThere is a ton of information there , and the information is terrific to begin with .
p9516
aVThe D2H is highly - configurable , with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use -LRB- resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time , for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera -RRB- .
p9517
aVI 'll just punch right in to the way it feels .
p9518
aVThe camera is a rather heavy beast , and for some , there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day , like I do .
p9519
aVBut the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through .
p9520
aVI 've long since given up using any camera bag .
p9521
aVAll I have are a fanny pack for a 14mm , 55mm , teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt .
p9522
aVAnd the D2H 's hold the 17-35mm Nikon and the 80-200mm Nikon one - touch or the Sigma 120-300mm 2 - touch .
p9523
aVShooting is a breeze .
p9524
aVThe batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge .
p9525
aVI have my D2H set on ISO 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower ISO as often as I can , because the higher ISOs bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation .
p9526
aVJust today , I purchased digital noise plug ins for Photoshop to limit this , and that 's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at ISO 800 and above .
p9527
aVI now have little problems with capturing images in even barely - limited lighting .
p9528
aVI recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an Airbus at 36,000 feet over the Pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f \u005c/ 2.8 , and it looks tons better than night shots via the D1H , which lacked the internal digital noise filter .
p9529
aVThat filter kicks in at around 1\u005c/2 second and longer exposures , and can make you wait as long as your image you 've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise .
p9530
aVWhen you shoot this way -LRB- and in general -RRB- , do n't simply react by cranking up ISO because you will not be happy with your results .
p9531
aVThe camera can be loud .
p9532
aVAt over 7 frames per second , it can make you obvious in a quiet room .
p9533
aVShooting sensitive situations can be testy , so limit your shooting to single frames .
p9534
aVI wish this camera had an option to silence this camera , but since the mirror has to raise and lower , there 's no chance to do this .
p9535
aVAm I happy with the D2H ?
p9536
aVDefinitely , yes .
p9537
aVAre there improvements that can be made ?
p9538
aVYes .
p9539
aVBut the benefits outweigh the drawbacks .
p9540
aVPeople have been bailing out of using the Nikon system and going Canon , which has some incredible gear , I wo n't deny that .
p9541
aVBut instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment , learn how to use the D2H well and you 'll be much happier than ever .
p9542
aVAnd that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations .
p9543
aVFor instance , white balance .
p9544
aVThis can be the best thing for you , or the worst thing you 've ever dealt with , depending upon how you approach it .
p9545
aVDaylight , gray skies , dusk and dawn are easy , because you can set the camera to daylight , flash , shadow -LRB- for dusk and dawn times -RRB- and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark .
p9546
aVBut the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue\u005c/green or orange - red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you do n't properly use white balance .
p9547
aVPreset white balance is king , here .
p9548
aVI can get gray , black and white when I preset in mercury vapor light .
p9549
aVAnd I used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting ca n't figure .
p9550
aVThere is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well !
p9551
aVIf you do this -LRB- and I can go on for miles here -RRB- , you 're on your way .
p9552
aVSo , with trying this D2H , or considering it , read through some of the digital D2H forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances .
p9553
aVGenerally , those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it .
p9554
aVI can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail .
p9555
aVWhen you have decent light , you 'll have a decent image .
p9556
aVBut when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system , you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable .
p9557
aVIn closing , I have not been paid by anyone , I have no Nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that I 'm giving the D2H credit where it 's long overdue .
p9558
aa(lp9559
VI have to say , I am very pleased .
p9560
aVThe camera works as described all functions .
p9561
aVI was able to watch the pets and gain some great information on their habits .
p9562
aVI do have a few things that I did n't like , but they do n't effect the functionality of the device .
p9563
aV1 .
p9564
aVIt 's like dealing with a high-end network device during setup .
p9565
aVSave and reboot , change 1 setting , save and reboot , change another setting , save and reboot , wash , rinse repeat .
p9566
aVThis can be a good thing though because you know the settings are being set , it just takes time .
p9567
aV2 .
p9568
aVIt did n't come with NVR Software , but it did n't say it did , I just thought that was a given , never assume .
p9569
aVAt the end of the day , after it 's all setup , it 's a good cam for the price .
p9570
aVI 'd say it would be a bit difficult to setup for someone not computer\u005c/network literate , and even then it took me an hour .
p9571
aa(lp9572
VTakes amateur photography to a new level .
p9573
aVI used to have a Canon SLR 10 years ago ... then switched to digital point and shoot camera - primarily because of convenience and portability and also because was n't really impressed either with the quality OR the price points of DSLR 's at that time .
p9574
aVThis camera addresses everything .
p9575
aVI shoot mostly personal family pictures , kids , functions at home and landscapes when traveling .
p9576
aVHave it paired with an EFS 17-55mm f\u005c/2 .8 -LRB- my only lens so far ! -RRB-
p9577
aVand image quality is mind-blowing .
p9578
aVGreat bokeh and low light performance .
p9579
aVI rarely use the flash .
p9580
aVRich , true and vivid colors even in low light with no flash .
p9581
aVWould have preferred to get the Full frame 5D - but body and good lens combined were beyond what I wanted to spend on my first DSLR .
p9582
aVPlan on using this as my first DSLR to get aquatinted before thinking of upgrading to a full frame .
p9583
aVHave a friend with the EOS 5D and I confess that the picture quality of 5D with a 24-85mm f\u005c/2 .8 is quite better and its the must have camera for anybody with serious ambitions in photography or spare change .
p9584
aVIn features and options though 7D is equal to the 5D if not better .
p9585
aVBut for starters - the EOS 7D is great - in fact exceptional .
p9586
aVTo realize its best potential pair it with a good and fast lens and NOT with one of the lenses that come packaged with it .
p9587
aa(lp9588
VGreat camera .
p9589
aVBought it for the kids .
p9590
aVEasy upload and re-chargeable batteries are a big plus .
p9591
aVNo AA batteries needed .
p9592
aVI have not tried it out , but it is supposed to be waterproof to 10 ft. .
p9593
aVThe kids -LRB- 8 and 5 -RRB- can use it easily .
p9594
aVPictures and video are acceptable for this level of camera .
p9595
aa(lp9596
VPurchased the Zi8 because I wanted a cheap and easy to use HD camera .
p9597
aVI mostly ignored the reviews negatively reviewing the low-light performance to give it a try .
p9598
aVI have now tried the Zi8 under a number of controlled conditions and have sent it back .
p9599
aVIn short , the picture quality in low-light conditions is simply terrible .
p9600
aVUnwatchable terrible .
p9601
aVIt is dark , grainy and fuzzy .
p9602
aVAnd by ` low-light ' I am not talking about being in closet with the doors closed and the lights off .
p9603
aVI am talking about anywhere indoors normally illuminated by traditional artificial lighting -LRB- like in your house -RRB- .
p9604
aVI repeat that ... anywhere indoors .
p9605
aVI even purchased a light to go with the camera and the indoor video is still terrible .
p9606
aVThe only place this camera works acceptably well is outside in the bright daylight-illuminated world .
p9607
aVThis makes the camera worthless in my opinion .
p9608
aVWho wants a camera that effectively can not be used indoors ?
p9609
aVI thought I might be able to get an HD camera on the cheap .
p9610
aVMy needs are not excessive .
p9611
aVI was not expecting to receive television-quality video .
p9612
aVI only wanted to use it for easy family home movies .
p9613
aVThis camera is not even acceptable for taking home movies if you use it indoors .
p9614
aVI have already purchased a higher end -LRB- and more expensive -RRB- HD camera .
p9615
aa(lp9616
VNot bad for the price , but it 's not entirely Mac compatible .
p9617
aVThere is no sound via any of the web viewers available to Mac users .
p9618
aVAlso you will likely need to reboot this camera a few times a month .
p9619
aVIt 's ok as long as you 're not away on vacation like I was .
p9620
aVTech support is friendly and responsive .
p9621
aVBut ca n't offer much real help for Mac users .
p9622
aa(lp9623
VGood camera .
p9624
aVIt looks very nice .
p9625
aVSmall and not heavry .
p9626
aVIf you are traveling and do n't want to carry too heavry things , buy a degital camera and you will not disappointed with the quality of the photos from LX5
p9627
aa(lp9628
VPrice is right .
p9629
aVBut it is otherwise pretty basic , and has some problems .
p9630
aV1 -RRB- Instructions are terrible , and if I was n't experienced with networking I do n't know if I would have figured it out .
p9631
aV2 -RRB- The infrared lights are really quite bright and obvious .
p9632
aVWe used it as a camera in my son 's room , but the red lights form a red `` eye '' that is kind of scary looking .
p9633
aVReminds me of `` Hal 9000 '' 3 -RRB- The color is very muted , so everything looks pastel .
p9634
aV4 -RRB- The sound is not working well .
p9635
aVWe actually returned it , thinking it was defective , and got another .
p9636
aVBut the sound was no better on the second one .
p9637
aV5 -RRB- In order to record , Internet Explorer has to be opened in Administrator Mode .
p9638
aVThis is annoying , because we 'll have IE open and we 'll be watching something on the camera .
p9639
aVIt will be interesting , so we 'll go to record it , but it wo n't record .
p9640
aVHave to close IE , reopen it using `` Run As Administrator '' and then record .
p9641
aVBut by then , we may have missed whatever it is we wanted to see .
p9642
aVOn the plus side , it works well with the free android app , `` IP Cam Viewer Free '' which we use on our phones and our Kindle Fire to watch what is happening on this camera .
p9643
aVThe WiFi works well .
p9644
aVThe night vision works pretty well too , at close range .
p9645
aVIt serves our basic purpose , which is to see if our son is sleeping or not .
p9646
aa(lp9647
Vthe camera is gorgeous .
p9648
aVso is the leather case .
p9649
aVbut for a fancy camera with a lot of heritage , i found the dlux a bit of a let down .
p9650
aVmy canon ixus 5mp took even clearer photos .
p9651
aa(lp9652
VThe quality of video is good in HQ standard modes .
p9653
aVHD video is ok in outdoor lighting .
p9654
aVVery pixelated indoors low light .
p9655
aVThis is common for most camcorders .
p9656
aVThe big benefit is the quality you get for the size .
p9657
aVThe stills are great .
p9658
aVIf you need a camera for on-the-go outside activities this is a great deal .
p9659
aVIf you want low-light functionality look at the $ 2000 Sony .
p9660
aVThen again you ca n't put the sony HD in your pocket .
p9661
aVI bought a 4gig SD mem card and it gives me over 50 minutes of video .
p9662
aVThe battery life is great .
p9663
aVAll the cables are included and the connection base is really conveinent to just drop on and charge without having to find to correct cable and plug end .
p9664
aa(lp9665
VOkay , lets look at the camera it fits in the palm of your hand , literally if you are right handed that is .
p9666
aVI am , so no problem there .
p9667
aVThe 2.5 LCD touchscreen folds out on the left side and is used to control various settings , exposure , effects , tape control etc. as well as provide an alternative to the color viewfinder .
p9668
aVThe LCD can also flip twist and sit back in it s dock facing outwards so you can still access the controls without it sticking out from the camera .

VI bought the Canon PowerShot S2 IS about a year ago , and have taken about 2,500 photos and about 15 video clips with it .
p9695
aVOverall , I am very happy with it , and if I were buying a new camera today , I probably would get the S2 or S3 .
p9696
aVThings I like about the S2 : \u005c* Extended zoom -LRB- 12x -RRB- .
p9697
aVI use it often .
p9698
aV\u005c* Image stabilization .
p9699
aVParticularly helpful when using a high zoom factor , or when shooting in low light with a low ISO setting .
p9700
aVIt makes handheld shots at slow shutter speeds possible .
p9701
aV\u005c* Electronic viewfinder means `` what you see is what you get '' , just like an SLR .
p9702
aVWhile not as sharp as an optical viewfinder , the ability to frame the picture without worrying about parallax more than makes up for it .
p9703
aVIn fact , one advantage over an SLR is that there is no mirror for it to move out of the way , therefore there is no mirror noise when taking a picture ; if you turn off the electronic sound effects , it is very quiet indeed -LRB- although not completely silent -RRB- .
p9704
aV\u005c* The screen moves and rotates .
p9705
aVI like that it can be closed -LRB- turned in toward the camera -RRB- and thus protected from scratches .
p9706
aVI have used it folded out and rotated forward in order to see myself in a self-timer photo .
p9707
aVI have used it to take `` clandestine '' pictures -- holding the camera down near my waist , I can still see the screen if I rotate it towards me .
p9708
aVI have also used it to take pictures while holding the camera above my head -- above a crowd , for instance , or over a wall .
p9709
aV\u005c* Multiple-picture mode .
p9710
aVSimilar to a motor drive in film cameras , this allows me to take several pictures in quick succession by holding down the shutter release button -- about 2 pictures per second .
p9711
aVAnd unlike some cameras , the only limit to the number of pictures is the amount of available memory .
p9712
aV\u005c* It can be used in all-automatic mode , all-manual mode , or just about any combination in between .
p9713
aVEven in near-automatic mode , several exposure settings can be adjusted .
p9714
aV\u005c* Very good movie mode .
p9715
aVIt will shoot a VGA-quality picture -LRB- 640x480 -RRB- at 30fps .
p9716
aVWhile the results are not as good as my 3-CCD DV video camera , I am much more likely to have this camera with me than the video camera , and I really like the option of taking a reasonably high quality video .
p9717
aVI have used it several times .
p9718
aV\u005c* Stereo microphones .
p9719
aVDecent sound for video .
p9720
aVCan also be used for adding a sound memo to a still picture -LRB- e.g. `` this is at such-and-such a place , blah blah blah '' -RRB- , or just for recording sounds unrelated to any picture .
p9721
aVI have used this a couple of times to record a `` sound memory '' of a place ; one was at a botanical garden at a spot where the scenery was n't especially pretty , but the sounds the frogs made were like nothing we had heard before !
p9722
aV\u005c* Separate buttons for still pictures and movies .
p9723
aVEasy to remember which is which .
p9724
aV\u005c* Manual pop-up flash .
p9725
aVSome people do n't like that the flash does n't pop up automatically when needed .
p9726
aVI actually like this feature , because often I want to shoot without a flash when the camera thinks I need to use the flash .
p9727
aVAnd of course I can force the flash to fire even in bright daylight when the camera thinks it is not necessary -- although for a while I kept forgetting how to turn on that feature on , even though it 's pretty obvious -LRB- there 's a button right next to the flash ! -RRB-
p9728
aV.
p9729
aVThings I do n't like about it : \u005c* Poor low-light performance .
p9730
aVMore precisely , poor performance at high ISO settings .
p9731
aVThe camera will do fine in low light if you leave the shutter open long enough , or use a flash .
p9732
aVBut if you kick up the ISO to 200 or 400 -LRB- equivalent to a `` fast '' film -RRB- so that you can take indoor shots without a flash , you end up with very noticeable graininess in the pictures .
p9733
aVThis is my number one disappointment with the camera .
p9734
aVHowever , I do n't know of a comparable camera that does better -LRB- and from the sample pictures I have seen , the S3 is n't any better ; I do n't know why they bothered to add an ISO 800 setting -- it seems completely useless to me -RRB- .
p9735
aVI know there are cameras that do , but they cost a lot more .
p9736
aVI saw pictures taken indoors with a Canon 20D SLR that were phenomenal .
p9737
aVBut besides the added expense , a camera like that is also bigger and heavier , and therefore less convenient .
p9738
aV\u005c* The camera is too big for a pocket .
p9739
aVI would love to have a camera as capable as this that would fit in my shirt pocket , or at least my coat pocket or a smallish holster .
p9740
aVI would take it more places if it was n't so big .
p9741
aV\u005c* And yet , at the same time , it 's a little too small for my hand .
p9742
aVThe grip just does n't feel right .
p9743
aVThe grip on the 20D felt GREAT !
p9744
aVHowever , it 's just about right for a woman 's hand -- my wife likes it fine .
p9745
aV\u005c* No filter threads in the standard configuration .
p9746
aVA big lens like that is practically begging for fingerprints or scratches .
p9747
aVI solved that by adding the conversion lens adapter , which does have filter threads -LRB- more about this below -RRB- .
p9748
aV\u005c* Lens cap is held on by friction .
p9749
aVThis is both a pro and a con .
p9750
aVIt 's good because the lens extends when the camera is turned on ; if the lens cap is attached the lens will simply push it off .
p9751
aVIt 's bad because the cap could come off when you do n't want it to .
p9752
aVThis is a moot point with the conversion lens adapter , as the standard lens cap will no longer fit .
p9753
aV\u005c* The default exposure is too bright .
p9754
aVNot every review mentions this , but apparently it is fairly common for Canon cameras .
p9755
aVFortunately , this is easily fixed by setting the exposure adjustment -LRB- I set mine to -2 \u005c/ 3 stop -RRB- .
p9756
aVI have n't figured out how to adjust the exposure for movies , though .
p9757
aVI need to look in the manual to see if it 's possible !
p9758
aVIf you buy the S2 -LRB- or S3 -RRB- , I 'd suggest also considering : \u005c* Canon LAH-DC20 Lens Adapter and Hood Set .
p9759
aVAs I mentioned above , this allows you to add a filter to protect the lens .
p9760
aVCurrently $ 37.10 at Amazon .
p9761
aV\u005c* A 58mm skylight or UV filter to screw on to the lens adapter .
p9762
aV\u005c* A 58mm lens cap to cover the adapter\u005c/filter .
p9763
aVCanon 's 58mm Snap-On Lens Cap is currently $ 9.99 at Amazon .
p9764
aV\u005c* A high-speed SD card , at least 512MB , but 1GB or 2GB would give more space for movies .
p9765
aV-LRB- I use a SanDisk Ultra II Plus , which has the added benefit of being able to directly plug into a standard USB port without an adapter . -RRB-
p9766
aV\u005c* Rechargeable NiMH batteries .
p9767
aVI do n't have any yet , but this is the next thing on my list .
p9768
aVI 've gone through way too many AA batteries !
p9769
aVA nice option available for this camera is the TC-DC58B Tele Converter Lens .
p9770
aVThis gives you a maximum zoom equivalent to 648mm on a 35mm camera .
p9771
aVAmazing !
p9772
aVI have not purchased it yet because so far the built-in zoom has been sufficient for my needs .
p9773
aVThere is also the WC-DC58A Wide Converter Lens for taking extra-wide-angle pictures .
p9774
aVAfter you get the camera , you 'll probably want a case of some type for it .
p9775
aVThere are \u005c* lots \u005c* of cases to choose from .
p9776
aVAfter trying a few and looking at a lot more , I finally settled on the Tamrac Velocity 4 .
p9777
aVIt may or may not be what you need in a case , but there it is FYI .
p9778
aa(lp9779
V... but a true outdoor bird enthusiast ??
p9780
aV... I tried these binoculars last spring and found that even a blue heron nearly disappeared in `` gray fog '' when I tried to zoom in .
p9781
aVBesides , it 's next to impossible to follow a bird in flight , the field of view is just too narrow .
p9782
aVIn general I love Olympus products , their quality is excellent , but this compact marvel just tries to pack too much of a punch for its size .
p9783
aa(lp9784
VI have been using Nikon and Canon DSLR 's for a while now .
p9785
aVI 've had Nikon 's D40 , D60 , D5000 , D90 to the Canon T1i , T2i and 60D .
p9786
aVThe Nikon D7000 is the best camera I have ever had , by FAR .
p9787
aVThere is nothing NOT to like about this camera .
p9788
aVI mean it does it all , and REAL well .
p9789
aVI 've always been more of a Nikon guy myself , but about 2 weeks ago I went and bought the famous Canon 7D .
p9790
aVIt was a nice camera but there was just something about it -LRB- hard to explain -RRB- that did n't feel right to me and I just was n't loving it all that much .
p9791
aVYes it is a nice-built , sturdy camera with 18MP and this and that , and it felt real nice in your hands but the images were n't looking how I wanted them to .
p9792
aVI returned it , I bought the Nikon D7000 and I was blown away .
p9793
aVThis camera , `` pound for pound '' , accounting what you get for the price , is the bessttttt DSLR camera out today .
p9794
aVIf you are reading reviews and thinking about getting this camera ... stop reading , and buy it ... NOW .
p9795
aa(lp9796
VI used to have a Canon Elura 2 , but I despised its nightshot capability and the battery life was dismal .
p9797
aVI discovered this camera searching several review sites and after seeing it in person , I was sold by its compact size .
p9798
aVThis camera is very easy to operate and the quality of footage taken with it is phenomenal .
p9799
aVThere are n't a lot of buttons on this camera , as most of the configuration settings are accessed through the screen-based menu system .
p9800
aVI 've read a lot of people find the menu system annoying , however I find that it 's laid out quite nicely .
p9801
aVOnce you pick a setting , the camera will shut down other options that are n't applicable given the settings you 've selected .
p9802
aVI 'm very happy with the nightshot mode .
p9803
aVIf you 've ever watched Survivor , the night shots shots taken with this camera look like .
p9804
aVThe zoom control on the camera took some getting used to and I 've found that using your right hand middle finger to control it works quite well .
p9805
aVYou 'll also want to adjust the hand strap to firmly hold your hand to the camera .
p9806
aVI have not used the software that comes with this camera and that seems to be where a lot of the whining comes from on CNet .
p9807
aVIf you 're going to get a DV camera and you plan to edit the footage , invest in some decent video editing software -LRB- or buy an iMac -RRB- .
p9808
aa(lp9809
VI brought this camera back in 2010 .
p9810
aVIt work real good for about 6 months .
p9811
aVThen it took a turn for the worst !
p9812
aVRemind you I only used it -LRB- took pictures -RRB- about 5 times .
p9813
aVMy battery stop working .
p9814
aVIt do n't charge and I actually brought a new battery , still nothing .
p9815
aVI 'm going to try buying a newer battery because I need a camera for my wedding in March but after reading the reviews from the Kodak website I do n't think buying a new battery will work .
p9816
aVIf I was you I would only get this camera if I did n't need it for long .
p9817
aVOverrall it takes great pictures and is very light weight .
p9818
aVI just wish I had done more on it , but I 'm not giving up so fast .
p9819
aVGood Luck with this thing !
p9820
aVOn the website they do n't even sell this camera any longer
p9821
aa(lp9822
VWe got this camera to be able to monitor our pets when we are at work .
p9823
aVThe device has been working exceptional for us and the support has be outstanding .
p9824
aVWe love the night vision , the image clarity is fantastic , we usually `` demo '' the camera when friends come over our house and everybody is extremely surprise with the quality .
p9825
aVWe seriously recommend it to everybody
p9826
aa(lp9827
VT2i is amazing .
p9828
aVWhether you want a nice HD camera for fun , to take some pictures , to start a Photo\u005c/Video business or to produce an Indie Film ... the T2i is a great option for the price .
p9829
aVIf used correctly the Video can come out looking VERY Cinematic .
p9830
aVSlap on a nice L Series lens , shoot in 24p and use a Glidetrack for some dolly shots and you wo n't believe the results .
p9831
aVI loved it so much I bought a second one .
p9832
aVMy only gripe is the sound and the lack of manual control in that area ... but I record all of my audio on an external device anyways so it 's not THAT big of a deal .
p9833
aVIt 's just that , every once in a while I 'd like to go out and throw on any old mic and get some decent audio ... and I have yet to really do that .
p9834
aVSmall gripe for me personally .
p9835
aVYou may need to invest in a Rode Shotgun mic to get some decent audio if you do n't record externally .
p9836
aa(lp9837
Vit 's almost a profesional camera for anyone who wants to take realy good pictures .

VKodak PlayTouch Video Camera The Kodak PlayTouch produces beautiful videos and still pictures .
p9841
aVI set the video resolution to 1080p -LRB- the highest resolution -RRB- to get the best results , while the still pictures record at 5 megapixels -LRB- 3072 X 1728 -RRB- and the resulting pictures each takes about 1 megabyte of storage space .
p9842
aVThis is a small and convenient video camera that also has still picture taking ability , not the other way around .
p9843
aVYou should compare this with a Flip Ultra HD kind of video camera , not with a digital camera that also has video capability , or with a camcorder .
p9844
aVThe emphasis here is simplicity , small size , and video .
p9845
aVThis Kodak model is also known as model Zi10 , although it was not mentioned as such on Amazon 's product page .
p9846
aVAs the PlayTouch Video Camera , all controls on the back of the camera are touch-sensitive , similar to the Apple iPod Touch .
p9847
aVThere is only one small physical button -LRB- Record\u005c/Ok -RRB- and it is located just below the 3-inch diagonal LCD screen .
p9848
aVVideos and still images can be viewed on the camera LCD and on external TV 's and flat panel displays equiped with HDMI connection and also older RCA type connection .
p9849
aVBoth types of cables are included .
p9850
aVThe Zi10 can be charged using a computer 's USB port -LRB- connect via the camera 's USB arm -RRB- or using household AC -LRB- connect via the camera 's Micro-B USB receptacle -RRB- .
p9851
aVIt must be emphasized that while the USB arm can be connected to a computer for both charging and data transfer , the Micro-B USB port can only be connected to a computer for charging only .
p9852
aVThe AC adapter is very small , much like the Apple USB charger , and thus unobtrusive .
p9853
aVWhen the camera is being charged , the light ring around the Record\u005c/Ok button will blink .
p9854
aVA complete charge takes about two hours .
p9855
aVAfter charging is complete , the blinking light will cease .
p9856
aVThe Zi10 uses Kodak KLIC-7004 3.6 V 1000 mAh battery , which is also compatible with Pentax DL-168 and Fuji NP-50 batteries .
p9857
aVThe battery lasts about 1 hour and 15 minutes , so you will want to buy extra batteries .
p9858
aVYou may also want to buy an external charger .
p9859
aVThese -LRB- battery and charger -RRB- are available new on Ebay often below $ 5 each including shipping .
p9860
aVThe compatible batteries will most likely not last as long per charge as the original , but the difference is small and they are much less expensive .
p9861
aVThere is a switch on top of the camera that allows you to set the camera lens to take normal pictures -LRB- left -RRB- or close-up pictures -LRB- right -RRB- .
p9862
aVPerhaps some reviewer did not notice this `` feature '' and subsequently produced out-of-focus and blurry pictures and videos .
p9863
aVThe camera will turn on and be ready to take picture or video almost instantly after you press the power button on the upper right hand corner .
p9864
aVIn Ready mode , the picture viewing area is just 2 inches diagonal -LRB- 7\u005c/8 inch high by 1 and 3\u005c/4 inch wide -RRB- .
p9865
aVOther areas of the LCD consist of indicators and touch-sensitive buttons .
p9866
aVIndicators are the battery power level and the number of pictures remain that can be taken .
p9867
aVButtons include Setup , Still Picture\u005c/Video Switch , Play , Special Effects , Zoom In and Zoom Out .
p9868
aVIn Play mode , picture and video will take up the entire 3-inch screen , but must be rotated to a horizontal orientation for viewing .
p9869
aVIn terms of video resolution , you can select from WVGA , HD 720p , HD 720p 60fps , and HD 1080p .
p9870
aVThe HD 720p 60fps setting is for shooting fast action scenes , while HD 1080p has the best resolution and takes up the most storage space .
p9871
aVAt this setting , a 4 Gb card will last about 30 minutes .
p9872
aVFor still picture , the camera takes 5 megapixel images ; a 4 Gb card will accomodate 2,184 shots .
p9873
aVThe camera features image stabilization and face detection .
p9874
aVDisplay text can be set to any one of 15 languages .
p9875
aVThere are five special effects that can be applied to still picture and video : normal , high saturation , 70 's film , black  white , and sepia .
p9876
aVProblems : 1 .
p9877
aVIf you put in a SD memory card that has all its storage space used up , the camera will display a message : Memory card is full .
p9878
aVStrangely , under this circumstance , you will NOT be able to format the card in camera , as you can not use the camera at all .
p9879
aVYou need to format the card or delete some pictures in another camera or computer .
p9880
aVI am guessing that maybe Kodak does this to prevent accidental erasure of precious videos and pictures .
p9881
aV2 .
p9882
aVThe built-in USB arm is convenient to use to download pictures and videos to a computer , but its construction seems pretty flimsy that I do n't feel comfortable to have the whole camera 's weight hang on the arm .
p9883
aVInstead , I use an USB extension cable so that the camera can be placed on a flat surface while it 's connected to a computer .
p9884
aVUnlike the Flip video camera 's built-in memory , because the PlayTouch stores pictures on removable SD memory cards , sometimes it 's easier to just take out the SD card and load it onto a computer than using the USB arm .
p9885
aVAt least , you have a choice to use either method .
p9886
aVActual use experience : Because this is primarily a video camera and secondarily a digital still picture camera , when you turn on the camera , it will always be in video mode .
p9887
aVIf you want to take still pictures , you must press the capture mode -LRB- still picture\u005c/video camera -RRB- button on the lower left of the LCD screen .
p9888
aVBecause the camera does not have a built-in flash , pictures and videos taken are limited to available-light lighting condition only .
p9889
aVAlthough there is some shutter-lag when taking still picture , I like the fact that I can take a video of a scene than extract a single video frame to produce a picture , right on the camera .
p9890
aVFull-HD means the resolution is 1920 X 1080 , which yields 2,073,600 pixels or 2 MP .
p9891
aVThis is considerably lower resolution compared to what this camera in still picture mode can produce - 5 Megapixels .
p9892
aVStill , if you shoot a video then extract a critical frame , it is better than missing the perfect shot all together .
p9893
aVLike any electronic gadget , this camera is a delicate piece of equipment .
p9894
aVAlthough the camera comes with a velvet pouch , it offers little protection against bumps and shocks .
p9895
aVInstead , I use a Lowepro Rezo 30 zippered pouch -LRB- $ 12 on Amazon -RRB- to securely store this camera .
p9896
aVThis bag has a front pocket that can store extra batteries and memory cards .
p9897
aVIf you want to save some money , then I would recommend AmazonBasics Universal Camera Case for Digital Cameras HF , which is less than $ 5 and it also has a pocket for extra things .
p9898
aVIt is slightly less snug -LRB- meaning bigger inside and outside -RRB- than the Lowepro .
p9899
aVI have not encountered any freeze-up conditions described by some reviewers .
p9900
aVMy Camera Firmware Version is 1.160012 .

VI bought this camera and was fairly happy with it for about a year .
p9903
aVSometimes it took very blurry pictures , but overall they were good quality pictures and it feels good to hold .
p9904
aVHowever , I had the same problem as `` Niwot Bob '' described below .
p9905
aVAfter about a year I started having a lot of trouble with this camera , I could n't get it to turn on or take pictures at all .
p9906
aVI called Sony 's service center and they wanted $ 120 just to look at it .
p9907
aVI 'm not the only person I 've heard of to have these problems with this camera .
p9908
aVI would suggest finding another model or you will be shopping for another one not long after the warranty expires .
p9909
aa(lp9910
VI got this camera for Christmas .
p9911
aVReally happy with the quality of the pictures considering that the cost was inexpensive .
p9912
aa(lp9913
VI bought this charger to charge batteries for my old Sony CCD TRV16 NTSC camcorder .
p9914
aVI had just bought new NP-F550 batteries which did n't need chargging , so I have n't used it for them yet .
p9915
aVBut I did use it for the original battery that came with the camera which I believe was an NP-F330 .
p9916
aVIt charged the old battery adequately even though the battery did n't hold a charge for long due to age .
p9917
aVNo longer have to charge through the camcorder which is the main reason I bought this charger -- a major convenience for me now .
p9918
aVI highly recommend this product .
p9919
aVShipping was fast , too .
p9920
aa(lp9921
VI looked at many compact binoculars before settling on this pair , and I have n't been disappointed .
p9922
aVSmall and light enough for a coat pocket , fanny pack , or even a generous pants pocket ... distortion free viewing ... and a nifty zoom feature for close-ups which is rather unusual in compact models .
p9923
aVThe zoom feature is particularly useful because you never really know just how far away you 're going to be from something interesting .
p9924
aa(lp9925
VI bought this camera a week before I left for India on a holiday and the David Busch book turned up two days before so I did n't have much time to experiment with it before I left .
p9926
aVFor many years I had a film SLR and was an enthustiast but gave up my SLR many years ago as my interest waned and had been using a nice Sony compact digital for the last few years .
p9927
aVI quickly flicked through the Busch book and grasped the basics of the controls and left for India with just a basic knowledge .
p9928
aVI therefore left the camera on auto because everything happens so fast there and there 's no time to fiddle and adjust .
p9929
aVWhen I did have time I was able to find the necessary adjustment button quite quickly and the results were everything I could have asked for .
p9930
aVI have just returned and had the first opportunity to review the photos on my TV .
p9931
aVI must say that I am in awe of this camera .
p9932
aVThe colors are superb and brought out all the richness of Indian colors and that is with std AWB and without the vivid color feature .
p9933
aVThe video was outstanding in my opinion within its limits -LRB- no zooming or focus adjusting while filming -RRB- but it did n't effect the overall result .
p9934
aVThe photos look very sharp and as good as a SLR when played on the TV or computer .
p9935
aVLow light pictures were again very good and of course there 's going to be some grain but it did n't spoilt the photo and we 're talking about really low light stuff here .
p9936
aVThere are many more features I have to learn to bring out the best in the camera and many hundreds of hours of reading as well .
p9937
aVBut you can be safe in the knowledge that while you are learning you can leave it to the camera and it wo n't let you down .
p9938
aVThere 's only one caveat and that is I wish it had a slightly longer zoom .
p9939
aVThere were times I could have done with something a bit longer .
p9940
aVHowever , I bought the camera knowing this and that does n't detract from the score .
p9941
aa(lp9942
VI recently ordered this as a father 's day gift for my husband because we were looking to upgrade from the Canon Elph we bought a couple of years ago .
p9943
aVThis one is just as easy to use , but with better image and stability .
p9944
aVWe are not professionals so I bought one of the guide books to go with it , along with the extra memory card and case .
p9945
aVI 'm very happy with the purchase and glad I bought it here on Amazon - no sales tax and shipped very quickly -LRB- I have Prime -RRB- .
p9946
aVHighly recommended !
p9947

p9949
aVProblem : When , in playback mode , on a protected img .

p9951
aVWorkaround : Never press the discard button in playback mode .

VI bought the Sony Pocket Reader to minimize weight carried while traveling .
p9956
aVI am so happy with my purchase .
p9957
aVI travel for work frequently found that I used to travel with at least two books .
p9958
aVI finally got tired of luging around the extra weight and decided to go with an e-book reader .
p9959
aVMy reading hobby is just that ... reading !
p9960
aVI do not have the need to highlight , or write in the margins , or touch the screen .
p9961
aVI have a pretty extensive vocabulary so I have no need for a dictionary .
p9962
aVAfter weighing all of the pros and cons , I decided to go for the Sony over the Kindle .
p9963
aVIts cheaper and smaller and just worked for me .
p9964
aVI also have no need to download books through wireless connections .
p9965
aVAs soon as I purchased the reader and started to play around with it , I had about 50 books uploaded in no time .
p9966
aVThis should keep me occupied for quite some time .
p9967
aVAs I hear of new books , I download them and automatically sync them when I plug the device in to charge .
p9968
aVIt really ca n't get any better than that !
p9969
aVThe only issue I had was the Sony software for the reader .
p9970

aVDo not find it difficult to use the different functions and there is an explanation of what each function is best used for .
p9985
aVThe only problem I have had is with the charger .
p9986
aVPlaced the batteries in charger and left them for over 24 hours and they never fully charged .
p9987
aVThe charger was very hot when I finally gave up trying to fully charge the batteries .
p9988
aVAccording to the instructions the batteries take 22 + hours to charge so I purchased a rapid charger that will charge them in 2 hours .

VMy husband and I looked all over for a film camera and almost every place had digitals only .

aVI hate to say it but we both have issues with digital .

aVWe finally found the camera here and my husband is pleased .
p10012
aa(lp10013
VI purchased the Coolpix in order to have a good digital camera for my parents ' 50th anniversary celebration .
p10014
aVWhen we used it , many of the pictures looked fine on the camera 's viewing screen , but were fuzzy and blurred when viewed later on the computer screen .
p10015
aVI understand that resolution will be better the smaller the image is , but the pictures were not lacking in resolution - they were just plain blurred - like the photographer moved .
p10016
aVThis should have shown up better on the camera 's screen so the photographer would know to take another shot .
p10017
aVIn addition , I was under the impression that the camera had a stabilization feature that would reduce the liklihood of blurred shots due to camera movement , but perhaps I misunderstood that feature .
p10018
aVA number of the pictures had questionable color quality .
p10019
aVReds looked like hot pink , and it was not possible to properly correct the red color without affecting other aspects of the photos , such as skin tones .
p10020
aVIn order to be fair , it is not the top of the line model , and maybe my expectations were too high for the model I purchased .
p10021
aVIt is possible that some of the problem lies with the operator and not the camera .
p10022
aVI hope that photo quality improves as I gain more experience with it .
p10023
aVI am not giving up on it yet !
p10024
aVOn the positive side , it is a nice , compact , lightweight camera , yet it appears to be well-made and durable .

VI bought the d50 a few days before Christmas and started shooting immediately and am moderately pleased with it .
p10032
aVAfter reading over 100 of the reviews , I believe now my camera might be faulty .
p10033
aVIn some of the preset modes the button is not reactive as it should be b\u005c/c there 's about a 3\u005c/4 to 1 second delay ... and only occasionally .
p10034
aVMY BIGGEST COMPLAINT is about the built-in flash ... .
p10035
aVit fires off but in the picture does n't show any trace of a flash .
p10036
aVThe flash is firing 100 % of the time -LRB- I think -RRB- it 's supposed to .
p10037
aVAbout 60 % of the time , the picture that is taken when the flash is firing shows zero indication that there was even a flash involved .
p10038
aVI have checked all of the settings , done both a hard reset -LRB- twice -RRB- and several soft resets to no avail .
p10039
aVI know about the different flash settings for slow and rear and curtains and such but all settings I try do not change anything .
p10040
aVThis `` phenomena '' is not confined to one or two settings ; this problem occurs on every auto setting a flash can fire in .
p10041
aVI think it might be a timing problem internally somehow .
p10042
aVI think if I can get these two problems squared away , I will definitely be one of the over 100 satisfied owners of the D50 .
p10043
aVFeel free to comment if you think there is something I can try to fix these problems .

aVHonestly I do n't know as I used professional software -LRB- adobe encoder and adobe premier pro cs4 -RRB- to do all my encoding .
p10092

VThis is a nice camera if you are just getting into the whole digital camera game .
p10101
aVIt wo n't do everything you want , but it is an inexpensive way to get started to see if you wish to continue in the digital point and shoot game .
p10102
aVYes , I agree , it does go throught batteries fairly quick , but if you buy yourself some rechargeable batteries , so what .
p10103
aVThis does very good for everyday and vacation photos .
p10104
aVThis is not necessarily for someone who has been taking digi-photos for a while , but for someone who wants a decent camera at a decent price .

p10113
aa(lp10114
VI have owned 3 previous pentax cameras , all of which gave good performance and durability .
p10115
aVI bought this compact camera because of its 5 spot focusing feature .
p10116
aVThe focusing features work very good and are improved over the previous models .
p10117
aVHowever , there is a significant red eye problem with this camera when using the flash .
p10118
aVAs a former professional photographer , I believe this is due to the flash being located one inch closer to the camera lens than previous models .
p10119
aVUsually , the farther the flash is off center from the lens , the less the chance of red eye reflection .
p10120
aa(lp10121
VOverall : good camera for the price .
p10122
aVGood value .
p10123
aVLots of neat features -LRB- plus manual control -RRB- and great optical zoom .
p10124
aVPros : Lots of nice art features and scene presets .
p10125
aVManual controls are really great for `` artsy '' shots .
p10126
aVThe shutter can stay open for up to 15 seconds , great for night sillhouettes of trees .
p10127
aVTime lapse shutter needs a tripod .
p10128
aVShoots great outdoor shots in full light .
p10129
aVFocuses quickly .
p10130
aVGreat optical -LRB- real -RRB- zoom level and stable at max zoom .
p10131
aVManual focus lets you decide what the focal plane is -LRB- we did this with chrystals with good results -RRB- - sometimes nothing beats the human eye .
p10132
aVCons : Lowlight seems a bit noisy .
p10133
aVNo viewfinder , just an LCD , so it 's sometimes hard in full light .
p10134
aVIt 's easy to get caught up in all the settings , but they are there , so that 's good -LRB- note that it has an easy setting to fall back on -RRB- .
p10135
aVCanon layout takes a little getting used to .
p10136
aVFlash charge takes a couple seconds .
p10137
aVNo issues with batteries - using $ 13.00 energizer 2000mAH set of 4 with charger - life and time used seems fine - 80 pictures or so .
p10138
aVUsing a class 10 sandisk memory card , no issues .
p10139
aVOriginally , we were looking at the elph 300 and chose this because of the optical zoom and manual controls .
p10140
aVIf you do n't need the zoom or manual stuff , then the elph might be a good alternative to this .
p10141
aVI think of this camera as a `` point  shoot + '' .
p10142
aa(lp10143
VI 'm very happy with my new Zi8 .
p10144
aVThe video quality 's amazing , and it 's easy to use .
p10145
aVThe only downsides are the exterior of the camera -LRB- it 's a fingerprint magnet , but you can buy a silicone skin and solve that problem -RRB- , and the audio .
p10146
aVI think the audio 's shortcomings were even more obvious when compared to the picture quality , the audio just did n't come close .
p10147
aVThat can easily be remedied , though , by purchasing an external mic like I did -LRB- do some shopping around and you can get one cheap -RRB- - it made a big difference .
p10148
aVOtherwise , I 'm satisfied with my purchase , and would recommend it to anyone .

VI purchased this camera after my FLIP generation 2 was stollen .

aV-LRB- i loved my old FLIP .

aVI was using it to film my childs `` firsts '' -RRB- Once i realized my camera was stollen I looked on amazon for another one , ignoring the bad reviews because I had such good luck with my old camera .
p10153
aVI had to rush order the camera in order for it to be here and ready for my child 's first christmas festivities .

aVI received it with in two days and immediatly took it out the box and plugged it in my computer -LRB- MAC -RRB- to charge -LRB- over night -RRB- .
p10155
aVWhen i woke up in the morning , I removed it from the computer and tried to turn it on ... NOTHING .
p10156
aVThinking I had maybe plugged it in wrong , I tried again -LRB- this time checking to make sure the red light was on next to the lends and the screen was flashing the battery pack . -RRB-
p10157
aVAfter 4 hours , i unplugged it and tried to turn in on ... NOTHING .

aVNOTHING .
p10162
aVI called FLIP customer service and they told me to hold down the power button for 10 seconds and that would fix the charging problem .
p10163

p10164
aVNeedless to say it did n't help and they said there was nothing else they could do .
p10165

p10172
aVBut any other pictures taken were dark .
p10173
aVI could n't even find the target .
p10174
aVI had to follow the lamp in the living room and move the camera down to floor where our dog is because the view window was black .
p10175
aVOnly the light stood out .
p10176
aVI read all the directions one by one exactly as it said and it still takes crapy pictures .
p10177
aVWhen you put the flash on the pictures come out when you look at them white .
p10178
aVSo bad you ca n't even see what the picture is .
p10179
aVI tried taking a pictures of my sisters bridal shower today and now the pictures are coming out red .

aVIt was small .
p10184
aVYou did n't need batteries .
p10185
aVIt had a charger .
p10186
aVBut I 'm sending it back .

VI believe compactness of a camera doubles its usage , as its not hassle to carry , and you do n't stand out in crowd while shooting .
p10192
aVThis compact pocket size cam is packed with quality features , excellent video , easy touchscreen operation and convenient download of still and video to your PC .
p10193
aV640x480 still resolution looks lil less , but ok for emailing and web purpose .

VI was a little apprehensive about getting the camera due to mixed reviews online but now am happy i did .
p10200
aVThe camera shoots great but does take some getting used to .
p10201
aVIt took me two days of testing and reading the manual but it was worth it .
p10202
aVIf you read the manual , using the camera becomes easier and easier .
p10203
aVI do not understand why some reviewers said that it was so hard , all the buttons you need are easily accessible .
p10204
aVThe only downside is that the focusing is very tricky .
p10205
aVI recommend zooming in on manual mode or using af-c .

VI read lots of reviews on this camera before buying it , and half of them scared the hell out of me thinking that this waterproof camera was n't going to be able to hack my vacation to the Caribbean .
p10208
aVThose other peeps must have had a lot of misfortune , cause I used it exactly like the instructions say , and needless to say , I still have a full functioning waterproof camera after swimming around in the Caribbean and island hoping for 10 days .
p10209
aVI liked all the features on this camera more than the others out there , so that is why I bought it .
p10210
aVI swam around with this camera in my pocket , took lots of underwater pics and videos .
p10211
aVMy pictures turned out amazing , and everyone in my group was super jealous of my sleek looking camera , and the waterproof-ability of it .
p10212
aVNever had a single problem with it .
p10213
aVMy only complaint about this camera is that the functions are way slow compared to other cameras .
p10214
aVTakes forever to play back pics , flip through them , begin video recording .
p10215
aVThat sort of thing .
p10216
aVOverall im pleased with it though , and look forward to using it again .
p10217

p10219
aa(lp10220
VThis is a high quality high-end camera with more features than I will ever use .
p10221
aVThe instructions are very good because they are written in `` plain English '' and explain the camera starting from the most basic functions in a way that is easy to learn .
p10222
aVThe 6.1 MP definition may be half that of Kodak 's new 12 MP but 6 MP is more than adequate to provide crystal sharp 8 X 10 photos and 12 MP slows down my computer -LRB- on which I process all of my own photos -RRB- to the point where it becomes a chore .
p10223
aVI also enjoy the optional remote control -LRB- @ $ 25.00 extra -RRB- .
p10224
aVThe color processor is exceptional and photos get very little adjustment from my computer photoshop programs before printing .
p10225
aVThis camera is worth way more than I paid .
p10226
aV-LRB- I would have been willing to pay up to $ 800.00 -RRB- .
p10227
aVI presume that the lower price is due to the lower 6 MP -LRB- which is now lagging behind 12 MP in the market -RRB- because I can not find anything that is negative to report .
p10228

VI have been a Canon and Nikon DSLR owner for a long time .
p10230
aVI have owned Canon 40D , Canon 5D Mark ii , Canon T2i and so on ... I always though for best image quality\u005c/high ISO performance , these Canon\u005c/Nikon DSLRs are the only way to go .
p10231
aVAfter seeing the excellent reviews of NEX-5N , I bought one with 18-55mm lens .
p10232
aVI was in such a shock that it bested my Canon T2i in over all IQ in different lightings -RRB- and beats the Canon T2i in high ISO\u005c/low light by a wide margin .
p10233
aVIt even beats my canon 5D mark ii in high ISO\u005c/low light .
p10234
aVpreview.com 's compare engine also confirmed this .
p10235
aVThe video quality is excellent .
p10236
aVIt also have silent auto tracking focus , which allows me to video taping my fast moving 5 year old while the Canons can not `` auto-focus '' during video session .
p10237
aVAs for the `` clicking '' video recording noise , Sony fixed my in ONE day and sent it back with Express and I received in 2 days .
p10238
aVProblems fixed .
p10239
aVThe new bathes of the NEX-5N should have this issue resolved .
p10240
aVTHIS IS A NON-ISSUE going forward .
p10241
aVOverall , this is the only $ 700 camera that can beat much more expensive DSLRs in speed and IQ and high ISO\u005c/low light performance .

aVI 'm no photography expert but this camera has allowed me to seem like a professional ; the features are incredible .
p10246
aVSo far I have simply used IA mode and it takes some of the finest photos .

aVFor many years we used a Nikon and have many travel photos hanging on the walls .

p10253
aVI am thankful for making , what turned out to be , a very good decision in buying this camera .
p10254
aVI was reluctant since Panasonic did not seem to me to be a `` camera company . ''

aVI looked into reviews of the Canon Elph LT260 and decided to purchase it about a year ago .
p10260
aVThe Elph takes great clear pictures , plus the 2x zoom and up to 2 second shutter speed are an added bonus .
p10261
aVMy only issue is the poor red eye reduction .

aVShe was going on a cruise so I wanted her to have a good point and shoot camera and this one was great .
p10268
aVRight out of the box , it was easy to set up , program the date and time , and the pictures are clear and crisp and have great color .
p10269
aVI purchased an 8gb memory card for it and that gave her the ability to take 900 + pics .
p10270
aVThe camera styling is very nice , small , light and sleek .
p10271
aVThe only thing I did n't like was that this camera did n't come with any kind of case but that is an easy and cheap fix .
p10272
aVI would reccomend this camera for someone looking for a simple point and shoot at a great price .
p10273
aVI got the camera and the memory card for under $ 100 with free shipping !
p10274
aVCa n't beat it .
p10275
aa(lp10276
VI bought this as my first dslr , after point and shoots , and I 'm still learning .
p10277
aVYou will need to follow the manual and play with this camera as it has a learning curve for a complete noob and amateur like myself .
p10278
aVIt seems like quality and I like everything about it so far with my limited ability , but I highly recommend it .
p10279
aa(lp10280
VThis camera has so much software in it , I think that 's the real star here , the 3D stuff and the panoramic make this a joy to use .
p10281
aVI have taken a lot of great shots with this and it has been very easy to use .
p10282
aVThe Intelligent Plus camera setting pretty much lets the camera choose the right settings for the situation you 're in .
p10283
aVThe playback features are really cool too , as it lets you view panoramic , 3D and burst shot photos by tilting the camera back and forth , great control options !
p10284
aa(lp10285
VThis is a very powerful camera considering the small size and price .
p10286
aVFirst of all , the M -LRB- manual -RRB- mode is something that most pocket-sized point and shoot cameras do not have .
p10287
aVOnly the Sony H55 , the Panasonic ZS7 , and perhaps a small handful of canon and nikon pocket digital cameras have a manual mode that allow you to manually adjust the shutter speed and aperture .
p10288
aVI find that to be essential .
p10289
aVI love taking night shots , and you can not take a high quality night shot without slowing the shutter speed down and placing the camera on a support , like a gorillapod .
p10290
aVI can carry this camera with my gorillapod in my pocket and take long exposure , low ISO night photos that rival my Nikon D3100 or my Panasonic GH1 .
p10291
aVThose cameras take great night shots as well , but I would have to carry a backpack and tripod to take the photos .
p10292
aVThis camera is capable of taking very high quality daytime photos as well .
p10293
aVIn addition to some of my test shots , I have seen great photos taken on this site and flickr from other HX5V users .
p10294
aVThe Sony G lens is supposedly as good or better than the Carl Zeiss lens on other Sony cameras .
p10295
aVIn addition to being a 10 times optical zoom , it allows you to also shoot at a very wide angle , which is great .
p10296
aVI also like the GPS feature .
p10297
aVI just uploaded a photo I took at Disney World to flickr with this camera , and flickr showed the spot on a google map .
p10298
aVIt was within literally 10 yards of where I took the photo .
p10299
aVThe panorama mode is also a pretty neat feature that I will have some fun with .
p10300
aVAdditionally , this camera offers two different modes to take hand-held night shots that use some neat in-camera processing tricks to make them less grainy .
p10301
aVWhen a photo is taken in the `` handheld twilight '' setting , the camera actually quickly takes 6 photos at one time and combines them together so that the background is free of noise .
p10302
aVThere is another setting called `` anti-motion blur '' that does something similar .
p10303
aVI still do n't think the shots come out anywhere as good as putting the camera on a gorillapod and increasing the exposure time in M mode , but they come out much better than the twilight setting on any other point and shoot , with less grain and with no blur .
p10304
aVIt is better than using a flash or jacking up the ISO setting .
p10305
aVAnother interesting mode that I have n't used yet is the `` backlight correction HDR '' mode , which snaps two photos with different exposures and uses the difference to create an HDR-like image .
p10306
aVI have always been interested in trying out HDR photography , so that should be an interesting mode to try .
p10307
aVThe video on this camera is amazing for the price .
p10308
aVFirst and foremost , this camera 's optical image stabilization in video mode is amazing .
p10309
aVIt blows away the lens-based stabilization on my Panasonic GH1 or Nikon D3100 in video mode .
p10310
aVThese are much more expensive cameras .
p10311
aVAs a matter of fact , for my GH1 I purchased this huge geeky Merlin-style stabilizer in order to to take stable video while walking .
p10312
aVThe HX5V takes just as stable video without an external stabilizer .
p10313
aVNone of the flip HD cameras provide optical image stabilization ; only camcorders normally do this .
p10314
aVI can not over-emphasize how impressed I am with the optical stabilization .
p10315
aVSecondly , this camera offers both MP4 and AVCHD recording formats .
p10316
aVAVCHD is a great format for playing on large televisions .
p10317
aVIt is the standard for high definition recording , as its compression is more efficient than motion JPEG and you can record for longer periods .
p10318
aVI am not aware of any point and shoot camera or DSLR that shoots AVCHD video , other than a few Panasonic cameras .
p10319
aVI have tested the video mode on this camera in 1440 by 1080 in AVCHD and it looks great .
p10320
aVI have seen quite a few test videos on youtube by other users of this camera , and the video rivals my GH1 , especially during the day .
p10321
aVBut do n't expect miracles -- night video with a point and shoot camera with a slow lens and small sensor like this one is not going to be perfect .
p10322
aVIt will be grainy or dark .
p10323
aVFor night video , I do n't think there is much that can compare with the Panasonic GH1 with the F1 .7 pancake lens .
p10324
aVI can shoot extremely low light video with that camera at about ISO 800 and it is not grainy at all .
p10325
aVThe video I take with the GH1 rivals a professional movie camera .
p10326
aVOverall , if you want to have the power of a DSLR and good HD camcorder in one device that fits in your pocket , this is a great choice .
p10327
aVIf you do n't need the 1080 video , the AVCHD video format , the burst mode , the GPS , or the handheld low-light trick modes , perhaps you should save $ 100 and go with the Sony H55 .
p10328
aVI had the H55 for a while before this one , and I liked it a lot .
p10329
aVBut I returned it and got this one because of the additional features .
p10330
aVI figured I would regret down the road not spending the extra $ 100 to get everything I really wanted .
p10331
aVUPDATE : After using this camera for a few months now , I see what others are saying about the color issues .
p10332
aVI agree that the auto white balance is not accurate .
p10333
aVAnd most of my daylight photos come out dull .
p10334
aVI have to post process every photo I take with this camera and increase color saturation in photoshop or picasa .
p10335
aVI would probably downgrade by review to 4 stars now that I realize this .
p10336
aVI wish this camera had some internal settings to increase or decrease sharpness , contrast , and color saturation .
p10337
aVMy older sony W120 daylight pics come out more vibrant than this camera , regardless of the setting I choose .
p10338
aa(lp10339
VLiked the camera , reasonable video .
p10340
aVThen went on a trip with climbing team , other guy had go pro .
p10341
aVHis video crushed mine .
p10342
aVOne trip later -LRB- so now three uses -RRB- , went skiing and took a LIGHT fall .
p10343
aVCamera does not work .
p10344
aVThat 's the basics of these camera -- they gotta be durable in activity and this one is not .
p10345
aa(lp10346
VWhen I wired the camera to the router with the cat5 cable it worked fine .
p10347
aVBut when I unplugged the cat5 , the wifi did not work , until I fiddled with the Norton Internet Security -RRB- Network Security Map and set the camera 's Trust Level to FULL TRUST .
p10348
aVIt then started to work just fine , both with the camera right beside the router , and with the camera about 30 feet away on the other side of a thick wall .
p10349
aVGoing back into Norton Internet Security -RRB- Network Security Map I reset the Trust level to SHARED TRUST and the cam continued to work using wifi .
p10350
aVI note that the IP number assigned for wifi -LRB- 192.168.0.109:85 -RRB- is different than the IP number for the cat5 connection -LRB- 192.168.0.108:85 -RRB- .
p10351
aVThe 85 stands for the port number I arbitrarily assigned .
p10352
aVAfter installing the camera , when I paste h \u005c*\u005c* p : \u005c/ \u005c/ 192.168.0.109:85 into the Microsoft Internet Explorer IP entry box , it hooks the camera up directly via wi fi .
p10353
aV-LRB- Amazon does not allow full web address ... so I wrote h \u005c*\u005c* p in place of http -RRB- .
p10354
aa(lp10355
VFantastic video and features .
p10356
aVI 'm more than pleased with this purchase .
p10357
aVBattery life could be better but looking at it 's tiny battery I 'm not suprised of it 's small capacity .
p10358
aVI always carry a spare battery so it 's no big deal .
p10359
aVProblem is recently my Canon developed a strange sound .
p10360
aVWith the unit turned off or with the unit on but not recording as I tilt the Canon side to side or back and forth something inside is rocking back and forth .
p10361
aVIt has the sound like dropping a ping-pong ball onto a table .
p10362
aVThis sound is not present when I 'm in recording mode .
p10363
aVVideo quality and all functions are n't affected by whatever worked loose inside the Canon .
p10364
aVI would just have it looked at before something does malfunction .
p10365
aVI tried to send Canon a message through their site but I was never able to get the message sent due to a problem on their site .
p10366
aVIn all I 'm happy with the HF S200 .
p10367
aa(lp10368
VThis camcorder is easy to use so it was great for us starters .
p10369
aVBut the lighting isnt great inside .
p10370
aa(lp10371
VSummary : If you prefer or tolerate used equipment , find and obtain a respectable camera from the 1980s or 1990s .
p10372
aVIf you prefer new equipment , the Vivitar 3800N is a decent choice , but not as good as the best mechanical SLRs in their heyday .
p10373
aVBackground : I bought this camera in order to re-enter film photography .
p10374
aVI had my own darkroom kit since middle school .
p10375
aVI love technology and in 1997 bought one of the early consumer-oriented digital cameras -LRB- it came with a 2 megabyte compact flash card -RRB- .
p10376
aVAfter some years of digital photography I decided that there is much to say about film photography .
p10377
aVI wanted to leverage my investment in K-mount lenses , and because I prefer brand-new , I bought what seems to be the last of a dying breed : a purely mechanical SLR .
p10378
aVReview : The Vivitar 3800N is a steal considering how complex the mechanism is .
p10379
aVAnd I 'm satisfied because I got my money 's worth .
p10380
aVBut that 's the point -- it 's not very well built .
p10381
aVHate to say this folks : this camera is cheap .
p10382
aVThe serial number is a sticker on the bottom plate -LRB- not stamped into the metal -RRB- .
p10383
aVThe rubbery material that covers most of the back plate is sure to deteriorate over time -LRB- it 's sticky -RRB- .
p10384
aVThe multiple-exposure button is located right under and in front of the shutter dial , and it 's easy to press by mistake .
p10385
aV-LRB- To be fair , it 's a mere distraction , because pressing the multi-exposure button wo n't due any harm , because the button only works when it 's pushed in while the film winder lever is advanced to charge the shutter . -RRB-
p10386
aVThe mirror is hardly damped and makes a big clunk .
p10387
aVEngaging the self-timer immediately raises the mirror which stays up until the focal-plane shutter opens and closes .
p10388
aVNone of these issues are big deals -- the camera does work .
p10389
aVIt sports a vertical travel metal focal-plane shutter , and a diagonally split image rangefinder surrounded by a microprism ring area .
p10390
aVIf the Vivitar 3800N were sold in the 1960s , it would have commanded considerable respect .
p10391
aVBut film cameras evolved to T-rex levels in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
p10392
aVCompared to the mechanical cameras of that era , the Vivitar represents the lingering remnants of a bygone tradition .
p10393
aVPerhaps Pentax will consider a limited revival production run of the K1000 , KX , or MX .
p10394
aVThat would be something worth paying a bit over the Vivitar 3800N .
p10395
aVFootnote : I got the `` kit '' package , which includes a flash -LRB- the worst I 've every held in my hands -RRB- , a multi-exposure toy cap -LRB- hmm this could be a conversation piece -RRB- , a UV filter -LRB- nice -RRB- , batteries for the internal exposure meter -LRB- not needed for the camera 's operation -RRB- , two cases -LRB- a camera case and a kit case ; have n't had a SLR case in 35 years -RRB- , a roll of monochrome film , and a 50mm f1 .7 lens .
p10396
aVI got the `` kit '' package because I was curious .
p10397
aVKnowing what I know now , I would 've bought only the Vivitar 3800N body if I could have .
p10398
aa(lp10399
VGreat camcorder with reasonable price , the only con is that at night it does n't have extra light -LRB- it has the inlet for a light but not included in the box -RRB- so the outcome is not very clear .
p10400
aa(lp10401
VI love this camera .
p10402
aVI am not a professional photographer .
p10403
aVI use my camera to have fun .
p10404
aVI have taken over a dozen rolls of film and they all turned out great .
p10405
aVI have never owned a SLR camera until now , but I will from now on .
p10406
aVThis one is very easy to use .
p10407
aVI did get the deal with the case and all , but I paid only $ 368 .
p10408
aVAs for the comment about making more money , every store has sales .
p10409
aVSometimes you hit them , sometimes you do n't .
p10410
aVMy pictures -LRB- of my newborn son -RRB- are priceless and I am so glad they were taken with this camera instead of another .
p10411
aa(lp10412
VI bought this about 2 years ago and use it a lot on vacation and now and then other times .
p10413
aVIt is is a little complicated to use as it has many alternative features however the poctures are good .
p10414
aVI tried to use it yesterday and the zoom lens comes out and stays out .
p10415
aVThe controller that should move the lens has stopped working .
p10416
aVIt still takes pictures and videos , which I will use it for now but for ordinary photography I will have to buy a new one .
p10417
aVThis should not happen as as with all these things it cost two much to have them fixed so a new one is the only alternative .
p10418
aVWill not buy an Olympus again as this simply should not happen .
p10419
aa(lp10420
VInitial impressions are fantastic .
p10421
aVFor the price -LRB- 169 -RRB- this camera is a great deal !
p10422
aVPurchased this for my parents for Christmas .
p10423
aVI needed a compact yet high quality camera for everyday events and this camera thus far has been superb .
p10424
aVI might even buy one for myself .
p10425
aVSurprised to see that the camera has 180 and 360 degree panoramic mode .
p10426
aVWill update as i use the camera more .
p10427
aa(lp10428
VI ca n't believe the reviewer below gave only a three stars to this product because he or she ca n't figure out how to e-mail photos .
p10429
aVFYI , you can e-mail photos from MS Outlook , Outlook Express , Yahoo !
p10430
aVand nearly every other e-mail out there .
p10431
aVI agree Olympus should n't be taking advantage of people 's ignorance but why pack up a camera and send it back ?
p10432
aVSimply use one of the free e-mail programs out there .
p10433
aa(lp10434
VWhen I started shopping for a new camcorder , certain features attracted me to this one : mic input , manual audio level control , manual focus control , manual white balance , and manual exposure control .
p10435
aV-LRB- I like to tell my equipment what to do , not vice-versa . -RRB-
p10436
aVThe price helped too , or else I might have dropped $ 8-900 for a new DSLR .
p10437
aVNow that I have the R20 -LRB- I actually found a deal on a reconditioned one -RRB- , every time I try something different with it I love it more .
p10438
aVLatest revelation : not only does it have an external mic input , but you can use both the on-camera mics and the external input simultaneously , PLUS there 's control of the mix !
p10439
aVHow is this useful ?
p10440
aV-- you may ask .
p10441
aVWell , I use an external mono shotgun or interview mic , and mix in a little of the on-camera stereo mics , and I have a clear mono -LRB- center -RRB- voice recording with stereo ambiance .
p10442
aV-LRB- I 'm guessing that if you convert the stereo to mid-side in a DAW you could fine-tune the voice-ambiance balance more in post . -RRB-
p10443
aVI 'm visualizing use the touch-screen focus -LRB- it will focus on the part of the image you touch -RRB- feature for some classic rack-focus moves .
p10444
aVRight now I have my R20 rigged up with a Sign Video audio input adapter box , a $ 60 AT shotgun mic , and a standard flash bracket to hold the mic , and for less than $ 500 I have a great little rig , perfect for the videos a client wants me to produce for their website and the mini documentaries -LRB- again , for web -RRB- I 'm shooting at work .
p10445
aVLow light response is also pretty good .
p10446
aVSure , if you 're planning on producing a 1080p Blu-Ray feature , the smallish lens and sensor and AVCHD encoding will start showing their limits .
p10447
aVOther limitations : 50 minutes of recording is about all you can hope for out of the little battery , and the image stabilization starts losing it at anything but a pretty wide zoom .
p10448
aVI also wish the zoom went wider .
p10449
aVAnd , this is pie-in-the-sky , it would be great if you could detach the touchscreen to minimize camera jiggle .
p10450
aVBUT , waddya want for 300-350 bucks ?
p10451
aVI certainly got more than I would have expected , possibly the best $ 300 I 've ever spent .
p10452
aVI plan on adding an LED light array and one of the after-market battery packages , and maybe an inexpensive stabilizer when my client starts paying off !
p10453
aV... and maybe , eventually , a 2nd Vixia for 2-camera shoots .
p10454
aa(lp10455
VBinoculars work great and are lightweight and easy to carry around in my purse .
p10456
aa(lp10457
VI have been tracking this camera since December 2010 and Amazon finally got a sale going on since Panasonic released ZS8 .
p10458
aVOne of the biggest concern I have was the low light video taping and the noise that appears on the video .
p10459
aVThis camera had no problems recording in low light .
p10460
aa(lp10461
VBetter late than never with my review I guess .
p10462
aVYou get what you pay .
p10463
aVThe price was cheap but the picture quality was very poor .
p10464
aVEven in bright outdoor situations , the pictures were under exposed and grainy .
p10465
aVReally disappointed with this and we ended up buying a new camera soon afterwards .
p10466
aa(lp10467
VVery few people are going to give an accurate review of the new Nikon D200 , but I 'm going to try .
p10468
aVI 'm NOT going to review the D200 on its own .
p10469
aVThat 's not realistic or representative of how shoppers will seek out this camera .
p10470
aVAt such a high price , most buyers will have experience with digital cameras and DSLRs and be matching the D200 against other models .
p10471
aVThis review examines the new Nikon in that regard .
p10472
aVIF you are actually thinking of this as a FIRST DSLR , please STOP .
p10473
aVThis is most likely not a good 1st DSLR due to it 's complexity and steep learning curve .
p10474
aVPlease consider a D50 or D70s or the Canon 350XT which are also in the hands of plenty of professionals .
p10475
aVAll others please read on ... The Nikon D200 is fairly advanced DSLR which uses interchangeable lenses and works with the Nikon flash system to produce professional results .
p10476
aVIt has a lighting fast auto focus system , though this is augmented nicely by the additional SB 800 flash which increases AF accuracy even further .
p10477
aVFor 1699.00 you know this is a serious unit that can take amazing photos , but the real question that MOST people will ask is this : Do I need this level of camera over the D70s or D50 which cost a thousand dollars less ?
p10478
aVThe question can be answered quite simply .
p10479
aVIf you shoot action , such as sports or birds or any fast moving objects , the D200 's speed can serve you well , bringing a higher success rate .
p10480
aVFor more typical shooting , such as family , portraits and scenic , the advantages are questionable .
p10481
aVDo n't let the higher mega pixel rate fool you .
p10482
aVPrints from these cameras look just about the same .
p10483
aVThe D200 's higher resolution gives you more cropping ability , but the D70 or D50 are more than capable in this area as well .
p10484
aVThe D200 's higher ISO abilities are quite limited and this has been a major disappointment for users who have been honest about it .
p10485
aVThe Nikon D50 is better in this regard , as is the D2Hs .
p10486
aVThis is a major stumble at this price point .
p10487
aVSome users will claim good ISO , but it 's not forgiving in the least .
p10488
aVThe viewfinder of the D200 may be the single most improved area at this price point .
p10489
aVIt 's both bright and sharp compared to less models .
p10490
aVThis is not something to be taken lightly .
p10491
aVA bright viewfinder is key for proper composition .
p10492
aVHandling of the D200 is beyond excellent .
p10493
aVLike all of Nikon 's DSLRs , the D200 just gets it right in a way than Canon continues to miss .
p10494
aVThis is yet another reason why people buy Nikon as it seems to be designed by people who actually shoot .
p10495
aVThe D200 is a work of art in this regard .
p10496
aVPicture quality is excellent , but this is NOT a camera for beginners .
p10497
aVHigher resolution also means less sharp results without proper hand held technique .
p10498
aVThe D200 also employs VERY mild in-camera sharpening and this should be done in post .
p10499
aVThis is the polar opposite of cameras like the D50 or Canon 350 which deliver good shots right out of the camera .
p10500
aVThe D200 was designed to deliver as RAW a file as possible and allow the photographer final say in the digital darkroom .
p10501
aVBecause of this the D200 requires a fairly modern and fast computer with Photoshop or some other powerful post software that can handle the large files .
p10502
aVSo what you 're paying for here is a professional camera with superior focusing and shooting speed .
p10503
aVPicture quality is about on par with other DSLRs .
p10504
aVWhile some folks will claim otherwise , ALL DSLRs take great pictures in experienced hands and you 'd be hard pressed to tell them apart .
p10505
aVPro 's and enthusiasts buy more for handling than anything else .
p10506
aVIn that capacity the D200 does not disappoint .
p10507
aVCurrent Nikon owners take note !
p10508
aVThe higher resolution of the D200 may expose lower end optics .
p10509
aVThe D200 must be used with better glass to see it 's potential .
p10510
aVSo we 're talking about a serious investment here .
p10511
aVI currently use a 18-200VR , 12-24 , Tamron 90mm Macro , 70-200VR , 50mm 1.4 and so on .
p10512
aVAdd the flash , filters and so on all ad up .
p10513
aVThe cost of a DSLR and lens package can easily hit 5K and the D200 encourages you to spend more .
p10514
aVThis is not a camera to slap 200 dollar lenses onto .
p10515
aVIn the end , with a D200 sitting next to my trusty D70 , I ca n't say that the D200 takes better photos .
p10516
aVWhat it does do is allow YOU to take better photos .
p10517
aVIf it had better ISO range it would be a 5 star camera .

aVI 've given it 3 stars because at this point Nikon should have matched Canon in this area .
p10519
aVAnd by now Canon should have built a camera with proper handling .
p10520
aVChoose your poison , folks , but I must question the value of the D200 for the high ticket price .
p10521
aVI do n't see 1000 dollars worth of advantage over a D70s .
p10522
aVNot even close .
p10523
aVI feel that the Nikon D70s continues to be the best DSLR on the market for the money ... but if money does n't matter and you are an advanced shooter ... buy the D2Xs for 4.5 K and be done .
p10524
aVI also see the D2Hs as a superior camera even with 4MP .
p10525
aVAnd the D2Hs handles noise far better .
p10526
aVVery experienced shooters do n't need 200 % cropping in most cases .
p10527
aVDoes this all mean I do n't like the D200 ?
p10528
aVNo , it 's a great camera .
p10529
aVIt 's just not a stunning value and should be priced at 1299.00 at the most .

aVWhat more can I say ?
p10536
aa(lp10537
VOverall Design First off let me say that I will be posting the same review for both the ZR 500 and Elura 100 since I found them both to be basically the same in design , video , and audio quality .
p10538
aVThat being said the first thing to talk about is the overall design and ergonomics of this years ZR and Elura models .
p10539
aVThe main problem I had with the design is that the camcorder is simply TOO SMALL .
p10540
aVIt is much smaller than my old Canon ZR85 and almost as small as my Kodak CX7530 digital camera .
p10541
aVIt is so small that when you try to hold it your pinky finger will sit very close to the lens and will move in front of it occasionally and you will be videotaping your own finger .
p10542
aVThis also causes video to be shaky since you ca n't even get your other hand onto the camera to brace it from movement .
p10543
aVMy hands by the way are not large at all and I ca n't imagine how somebody with larger hands would be able to use this camcorder .
p10544
aVAs for design changes there are a few from the previous models and none of them are to my liking .
p10545
aVCanon has decided to make the viewfinder sit in a fixed position flush with the back of the camcorder for some very stupid reason on the three ZR and one Elura model this year .
p10546
aVNot only does the viewfinder not extend out and upwards like the old models but also it is smaller and virtually unusable .
p10547
aVI would guess that the viewfinder is probably about half as large as the one on older models was .
p10548
aVYou will have your face pressed against the camcorder when trying to see through the viewfinder .
p10549
aVPersonally , I choose to use the viewfinder rather than the LCD screen on my digital camera and camcorder and this was a major inconvenience to me .
p10550
aVIf you get a longer lasting battery on the ZR models I can only imagine that this will be even more of problem for you since they will sit out further than the viewfinder .
p10551
aVThe second design change that I did not like was that the lens and body of the lens now sits flush with the front of the camcorder instead of protruding out like it used to .
p10552
aVThis causes problems when trying to grip this small camcorder and as I said earlier your finger will occasionally slip and cover the lens .
p10553
aVThe next questionable design change is that this camcorder does not have an accessory bracket on the top meaning that even if you did choose to get an external microphone or light there is no place to mount it .
p10554
aVAnother problem is that while the ZR500 has a plug for an external microphone the ZR600 and ZR700 do not .
p10555
aVI have no idea why this is the case but it is pretty stupid .
p10556
aVAn Elura specific problem is that the battery sits underneath the LCD screen meaning that you can not buy a longer lasting battery unlike the ZR models .
p10557
aVThe Elura battery is about a quarter inch thick and I would imagine does not last very long regardless of what Canon claims .
p10558
aVControls\u005c/Menus Canon has chosen to go to the joystick for most menu controls and this is not the best system in my opinion .
p10559
aVI would rather have the controls on the body of the camera instead of trying to navigate with a clumsy joystick .
p10560
aVI found that when trying to push the joystick in to accept a change in the menu I would often nudge it to the side and enter a submenu instead .
p10561
aVThe second problem with the ZR and Elura models this year is some of the defaults .
p10562
aVBy default the sound is set to 12 bit , video is set to widescreen , and the wind screen is on .
p10563
aVAfter changing the sound to 16 bit and video to full screen they stay set to your liking but to keep the windscreen off you must be in manual mode and change it every time you turn on the camcorder .
p10564
aVI have never liked the performance of the Canon windscreen since it seems to cut out a lot of lower sounds that you may like to hear and this was a big inconvenience to me .
p10565
aVI also found that the widescreen button is too easily hit and can be accidentally turned on very often .
p10566
aVNow I know somebody will probably argue here and say that widescreen is better but personally I absolutely hate widescreen and I 'm surely not the only one with the preference for full screen out there .
p10567
aVVideo Performance Now I will review the filming performance of the camcorder .
p10568
aVI must say that I was pleasantly surprised with the low light brightness of this compared to others that I have tried .
p10569
aVCompared to the Panasonic GS120 , GS150 , Sony HC26 , Sony HC21 , and Canon ZR85 this was clearly the brightest picture in low light .
p10570
aVUnder a streetlight outside on Auto mode it looks very bright , even brighter than my old ZR85 was when turned on Night mode .
p10571
aVThe picture does have a LOT of noise and grain in low light situations but at least you can see something .
p10572
aVNight mode however is still absolutely useless since it slows down movement so much that people look like blurry robots .
p10573
aVIndoor performance is basically the same as older models which is very grainy with a large amount of noise and overall a pretty poor picture .
p10574
aVAlso I found that whenever you zoom in on something indoors the camera automatically slows the shutter speed down and movement looks about the same as when night mode is turned on .
p10575
aVThis can cause a problem when taking video of anything moving indoors .
p10576
aVOverall , after trying many different camcorders I would say that there is not a single Mini DV camcorder out there that can produce better or even comparable video quality indoors or in low light than VHS-C , Hi8 , and even the old VHS camcorders did , sad but true .
p10577
aVPerhaps if they stopped trying to make them smaller they would have larger CCD 's and take better video but that does n't seem to be happening .
p10578
aVOutdoor performance is basically the same for the Elura and the ZR models compared to my ZR85 , no real improvement there .
p10579
aVIt 's not the best and has some washed out looking areas when viewed on a large TV but overall is pretty good for the price .
p10580
aVThe image stabilization that Canon uses is horrible compared to Sony or Panasonic camcorders .
p10581
aVThe image basically floats around the whole time and is very annoying to watch in slow motion , as I like to do with many videos .
p10582
aVI would rather have no image stabilization rather than this garbage ; also it takes up pixels that could otherwise be used for sharper video .
p10583
aVAudio The motor noise of the ZR series camcorders and also the Elura 100 is a problem that can not be ignored and was the main reason that I returned them both to the store and bought something else .
p10584
aVIt is a high pitched squealing sound that feels like somebody is scratching a chalkboard in your ears , and makes any video you record unwatchable unless you watch it on mute .
p10585
aVThere is no way to get around this motor noise .
p10586
aVI tired using an external microphone held a few inches away from the camcorder and above as if it were mounted there but it just picked up the noise anyways .
p10587
aVHey , do n't take my word for it go ahead and take a look at any Canon forum and see how many people are complaining about this problem .
p10588
aVWhile some may say that the motor noise may be different from one camera to another due to a defect I personally tried two ZR500 's and an Elura 100 and all of them had the same problem .
p10589
aVI would say overall that the Elura was even louder than the ZR model .
p10590
aVThis noise is apparent in any recording situation whether there is a lot of background noise filming outside or in a silent room Overall Overall I would say that this camcorder is not a good buy unless you can put up with the motor noise constantly grinding in your ear when watching anything you record .
p10591
aVAlso , have a good look at the design and realize that the viewfinder does not move and see how it feels in your hands .
p10592
aVDefinitely the low light performance is improved from past models but still falls short of so called old technologies such as VHS-C , Hi8 , and VHS camcorders .
p10593
aVIf you have tiny hands , a small budget , and can put up with the motor noise this may be for you otherwise keep looking , I would recommend any VHS-C camcorder over this though .
p10594
aVI would say the Elura 100 is a better buy than any of the ZR models this year since it comes with a brighter video light than the top of the line ZR700 and also allows an external microphone for the same price , other than that they are pretty much the same .

VThis camera is fantastic .
p10597
aVIt takes great pictures , has a really powerful zoom -LRB- one can see things that one can not with the naked eye -RRB- , takes video that can rival most HD camcorders .
p10598
aVThe only downside I see is that it is not as compact as some of the point-and-shoots are .
p10599
aVIt is not as big as a dslr , but it does n't fit in my pocket either .
p10600
aVIf you do get this camera , do get a good sized memory card too .
p10601
aVI had a 2 gig card , which was sufficient for pictures , but would get used up pretty quickly with video .

aa(lp10629
VI 'm happy with the camera , but find that it does n't always take photos that are as good as the little canon p  s I used to have , because I 'm not particularly adept at working it or choosing the settings .
p10630
aVPROS : There will NEVER be a `` lens jam '' EVER !
p10631
aV-LRB- I 've lost 4 cameras to this error , why I went with a micro 4\u005c/3 -RRB- Much more compact than a standard DSLR Decent zoom - I debated buying another lens but this is sufficient for my needs Photo options I like : pop art , soft touch , etc. .
p10632
aVEasy to work menu options - I was a little nervous about this because I 've owned only canons for close to 20 years Price CONS : As other reviewers said , it is n't the best at taking photos of moving kids -LRB- sensor issues ? -RRB-
p10633
aV.
p10634
aVUnfortunately for me , that 's basically what I 'm taking pictures of .
p10635
aVThere is one setting I use that 's a sports option that does a decent job , but I find that there are still more pictures with movement blur than with my point-and-shoot .
p10636
aVThe battery charger is bulky - but you can buy a compatible , generic wall plug-in for about $ 5 Though smaller than a DSLR , it 's definitely not a pocket-sized camera For the price , I do n't think you can beat this camera .
p10637
aVI know it 's technology from a couple of generations ago , and likely the PEN E-PL3 is a better camera , but I was thrilled to get it for about what I 'd pay for a higher-end p  s. Like I said , I 've lost 4 cameras in 6 years to the dreaded lens jam , and wanted to spend my money on something that might last longer than 13 months .
p10638
aVThe camera has a really solid feel and I think once I learn better how to use it I will be thrilled , not just happy to have it .
p10639
aa(lp10640
VThis is a great beginners or intermediate camera , I love it !
p10641
aVI 'm by no means a photography expert , but wanted something more advanced and professional than what we had for taking pictures of our daughter - this camera is perfect .
p10642
aVIt 's fast , quiet , and easy to handle .
p10643
aVThe Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is wonderful - many pictures that I would take of my daughter ` on the go ' would often end up blurry or fuzzy and this feature greatly reduces or eliminates this problem .
p10644
aVI definitely like the Smart Auto feature , for somebody like me who is n't much into the technical side of photography this feature is terrific - I do n't have to worry much about things like light , and shadow and settings , the camera analyzes everything for me and produces the best pictures automatically .
p10645
aVAnother feature I really like is the ability to just hook the camera up to an HD-tv to view the pictures or video footage that is on the camera - instant viewing on the big screen , there 's nothing like it .
p10646
aVFor the price and amount of features I 'm very pleased with this camera .
p10647
aa(lp10648

VI bought this camera for a several reasons , as a backup to my aging Nikon 8008s -LRB- still going strong after 10 years ! -RRB-
p10652
aVand for a film body to use Nikon `` G '' lenses , and because of the Nikon USA Fall rebate .
p10653
aVUpon first opening the box I thought I 'd made a real mistake .
p10654
aVIt 's the lightest 35mm SLR I 've ever used .
p10655
aVThe viewfinder is rather small and none too bright .
p10656
aVCompared to the 8008s the N75 feels like a disposable camera !
p10657
aVUpon inserting the batteries and mounting a 50mm Nikon lens , things began looking up .
p10658
aVI bought the body only , and strongly recommend you do the same , and get a Nikon AF 50mm 1.8 lens .
p10659
aVThis camera balances beautifully with this prime lens !
p10660
aVMy hands are small , so the N75 felt just right .
p10661
aVAutofocus is quick , and I like the red confirmation light in the finder -LRB- same as on my D 70 digital SLR -RRB- .
p10662
aVWhen it comes to focus speed and silence , the N75 blows my old 8008s out of the water .
p10663
aVIt 's focus rarely hunts and the shutter is fairly quiet , as is the drive motor .
p10664
aVSwitching to Manual Exposure mode is quick and easy .
p10665
aVThis camera even has a depth of field preview button .
p10666
aVOverall this has become a favorite film camera because it is so light and easy to carry .
p10667
aVIt 's fast and the meter is accurate .
p10668
aVI wish the spot meter were easier to access , but that is my only real complaint .
p10669
aVIt does 90 % of what the N80 does at less than half the price .
p10670
aVThis is a great camera for a new photographer or advanced user looking for a backup film body .
p10671
aVThe nice thing is all those wide angle lenses stay wide , and shooting a roll of slide film through this little gem will convince you film is not yet dead !
p10672
aa(lp10673
VI bought my camera the latter part of 2002 .
p10674
aVIt is the Kodak Easy Load 35mm camera .
p10675
aVI am very unhappy with it .
p10676
aVI have not used it a dozen times yet .
p10677
aVSo , it is still new .
p10678
aVI use the same kind of film everytime that I use the camera .
p10679
aVThe film is stuck in the camera and will not come out .
p10680
aVThis would not be a problem except the pictures that I have on the roll are the people that I have worked with for 12 yrs and our company is closing .
p10681
aVI will NEVER buy another camera from you .
p10682
aVI am so disgusted and upset that I have lost valuable pictures .
p10683

VAs some reviewer said , if you have average networking knowledge , the device can be setup in 10 min : - plug the camera to a Ethernet port in your access point w \u005c/ DHCP enabled - find the allocated IP -LRB- either via IO scan from another PC or from Access Point - go to Internet Explorer -LRB- ... -RRB- or -LRB- ... -RRB- - enter admin info : admin and no password\u005c/blank .

aVClick Login -LRB- If you use Netscape or other browsers , use the second login button ! -RRB-
p10690
aV- setup wireless -LRB- Wi-Fi -RRB- interface - Go to admin settings and create another admin account , overwrite the default one , and USE A PASSWORD for God sake : -RRB- - For access from Internet , find the WAN IP of your Access point or use -LRB- ... -RRB- - Mail and FTP works like a charm I am curious how reliable the servo will be .

p10697
aV-LRB- I actually thought the GL1 was a bit better . -RRB-
p10698
aVThe only beefs I have with it is the construction , a bit plasticy , and there is no way to control audio -LRB- There is a AGC -RRB- .

aVi took these cameras to : Peru -LRB- 14days -RRB- , Baja -LRB- for 15 days -RRB- , Costa Rica -LRB- 14 days -RRB- .
p10714
aVThe Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA batteries last MUCH LONGER than the rechargeable battery packs required by this Canon S90 bottom line : great camera if you dont plan on taking extended trips in other countries ... or staying too far from home .

VI got one of these cameras as a present for my high school graduation , just in time for my senior trip to New York City .
p10725
aVIt was a great camera that took wonderful pictures ; I loved the low-light flash option -LRB- when I remembered to use it -RRB- .
p10726
aVMine was stolen just over a year ago and I 've been looking for another but have n't been able to find one until now .
p10727
aa(lp10728
VLike many Canon or Nikon owners , I have a DSLR for serious pictures .
p10729
aVWhat I wanted was something small , always in my jacket and ready to email .
p10730
aVAlso , if it breaks I need n't worry about repair ... just buy a new updated model .
p10731
aVThe SD1400 is exactly what I wanted for under $ 200 .
p10732
aVWhat 's the beef with some buyers ?
p10733
aVIt 's like comparing the Sizzler with Morton 's Steak House .
p10734
aa(lp10735
VThe product is not worth the investment .
p10736
aVAttaching it to the Nikon P500 impedes the camera 's functions .
p10737
aVIn addition , the telephoto lens does not really improve the image .
p10738
aa(lp10739
VNice little camera , everything that was order was received except for the color .
p10740
aVI order a silver but received a pink one .
p10741
aVThe gift was for a man but he was ok with the color .
p10742
aa(lp10743
VOverall I thought when I opened the package , `` Wow !
p10744
aVThis is gonna be great ! ''
p10745
aVI bought it to take to the Rush Time Machine tour .
p10746
aVWhat I did n't realize was that the battery time is less than two hours , and that the video time is pretty bad as well .
p10747
aVIn addition , if you want a nice wide screen look to your videos , the microphone is placed exactly where your finger will want to rest when you hold it .
p10748
aVVideo Quality The video is shaky , lacking any stabilization control software , and anything that creates a decent amount of light or movement on the screen will cause it to fall out of focus .
p10749
aVGetting it back into focus is n't easy , and the only way I found to get it jumpstarted is to take a picture with it , which is going to shake the camera as you move your finger and press the button .
p10750
aVEven taking a picture , however , is no guarantee that the camera will make its way back into focus , and you could end up like me during the sing Witch Hunt , panning the camera around trying to find something else for it to focus on so you can get in back into focus , touching the microphone in the process and generally ruining the whole thing .
p10751
aVMotion blur is also a problem .
p10752
aVOn nearly every video I took , blur is evident as I pan the crowd .
p10753
aVEven though I 'm moving slowly , it 's noticeable and looks really really bad .
p10754
aVSound Quality The focus thing is n't the biggest issue , however .
p10755
aVThe microphone holes -LRB- three in all -RRB- , are n't located in the front of the unit .
p10756
aVThey 're on the side .
p10757
aVExactly where your finger will want to rest should you decide to turn your Bloggie on it 's side so that you 'll get a nice widescreen version of whatever it is you happen to be watching .
p10758
aVWhoever decided to do that needs to be beaten soundly with a stick .
p10759
aVIt 's a stupid thing to have done , and ruined nearly every video I managed to take at the concert .
p10760
aVEven if you manage not to touch it with your finger , since it 's right on the side , it picks up the scratching sound of your finger and leaves little scratchy sounds in your video .
p10761
aVThe sound quality also gets really rough if you 're in a concert situation with a lot of distorted guitars and bass , or Rush , for example .
p10762
aVSoftware The software is a little buggy , and it 's faster to just drag and drop the files into Windows Explorer .
p10763
aVDoing it with the Bloggie software is slow , cumbersome , and if you 're using a little small netbook , you may not have the computing power to do it in a reasonable amount of time .
p10764
aVBear in mind also , that the Bloggie does n't charge unless it 's turned off , and that you ca n't offload it 's visual cargo unless it 's turned on , so while you 're spending the 10-15 minutes it takes to offload all that video , you 're burning your precious battery time , which is short indeed .
p10765
aVWant it back ?
p10766
aVGood luck .
p10767
aVThere 's no way to remove that battery , and charging it up to full takes about three hours .
p10768
aVComparisons I 've seen video taken at Rush concerts with other cameras .
p10769
aVThe Flip being one of them .
p10770
aVI do n't know why I did n't buy that one .
p10771
aVMy whole experience may have turned out better .
p10772
aVKodak supposedly makes a smaller camera that is great for this sort of thing .
p10773
aVFrankly I wish I had bought one of those rather than this .
p10774
aVIt 's a gorgeous little thing , all sleek and polished and brushed metal , but it just does n't live up to it 's good looks .
p10775

VI just sent back my Canon ZR50 for poor indoor video quality and high motor noise -LRB- which can be reduced by applying filters in CoolEdit , which is too time consuming -RRB- .
p10777
aVI replaced it with the Sony DCR-TRV350 and so far it has been performing fairly well .
p10778
aVOverall it has comparative specs including almost the same optical zoom level , and the A\u005c/D conversion feature -LRB- really nice if you want to capture video to a PC from an old camcorder or VCR -RRB- .
p10779
aVOn the plus side , it has good indoor video quality including low light situations and very low motor noise compared to the Canon ZR50 .
p10780
aVOn the downside , it is a little more bulky -LRB- uses 8mm tapes instead of mini-DV -RRB- , and has a black and white eyepiece viewfinder .
p10781
aVOverall I would recommend this camcorder over the Canon ZR50 .
p10782
aa(lp10783

aVI had a Canon film camera which I was using a my mother 's birthday party when my granddaughter decided to open and expose all the pictures .
p10790
aVI lost all of the pictures and decided I would purchase a digital camera .
p10791
aVI researched Canon cameras for about 2 months and decided on this one .
p10792
aVThis is my first digital camera and I decided on this one because of the features .
p10793
aVI like the color and weight of the camera , it 's easy to hold not too heavy .
p10794
aVI can put it in a small camera bag and carry it around .
p10795
aVThe LCD is nice , it allows you to see what you are taking a picture of before you take it .
p10796
aVYou can take pictures from different angles .
p10797
aVIt also uses AA batteries which is great .
p10798

VI really like the ease of use of this camera .
p10822
aVIt has many features but are so easy to figure out .
p10823
aVI have used it for my son 's school play and was able to take very nice pictures .
p10824
aa(lp10825
VThis camera underexposes all photos taken in the automatic mode due to poorly programmed software .
p10826
aVThis is a very well documented problem with the model yet canon pretends that there is no issue .
p10827
aVObviously this does n't affect photos taken in the manual modes but for this kind of money the camera should work better than my point and shoot on auto and sadly it does n't .
p10828

aVI just received the Bushnell Voyager 700x76mm as a recognition gift from my company .
p10834
aVMy excitement about what was a very nice gift was quickly diminished .
p10835
aVI have had it for two days now and can not seem to get it to work `` at all '' .
p10836
aVI am fairly intelligent and I am not new to telescopes , but this thing will amke you feel stupid The instructions are some of the most ambiguous and incomplete I have ever seen .
p10837
aVThe three eyepieces and the two lens holders seem to serve no useful purpose , and there are no instructions on how to use them or what results you are to expect .
p10838
aVThis Red Dot Finderscope is a joke , as it does not work .
p10839
aVI was able to see a vague red dot for about a few minutes during my attempt to setup this thing and have not been able to see one since .
p10840
aVOne of set screws that support the Red Dot Finderscope is loose inside the main telescope housing and I ca n't tighen it .
p10841
aVThe `` vague , or lack of '' instructions continue with no explanation about the battery placement in the Altitude Dial .
p10842
aVAfter you have done all the setup , you will notice an extra battery lying around , and if you are lucky , or smart , you will figure out it goes in the Altitude Dial .
p10843
aVThe `` focusing the telescope '' and `` aligning the finderscope '' procedure does not work .
p10844
aVOne precedes the other , but it really should be the other way around .
p10845
aVThe telescope does not focus and you leave the alignment to chance - hoping you have done it correctly .
p10846
aVBased on the instructions , you 're to simply look down the barrel of the telescope - go figure .
p10847
aVThis is not a beginner 's telescope for sure , at least , not based on the poorly written instructions .
p10848
aVI can not seem to figure out just whom the instructions were written for - certainly not a beginner .
p10849
aVMy hopes and excitement was quickly shattered , even though I received this as a gift .
p10850
aVI am going to return it to my employer and ask them to return it to Bushnell along with a copy of this feedback .
p10851
aVI will wait until I can afford to buy me another brand .

VThe Minox GTE is a no nonsense high quality photographic machine .
p10854
aVIt has an excellant 2.8 high speed lens .
p10855
aVThe camera uses scale focus , this means you estimate the subject distance and set the lens to that distance .
p10856
aVIt has no range finder .
p10857
aVYou can set the F stop you desire and the camera will set the shutter speed .
p10858
aVYou can of course set the shutter speed indirectly buy ajusting the arpeture ring on the lens .
p10859
aVThe selected shutter speed can be read in the view finder .
p10860
aVAll curent versions of the camera feature a snap shot index on the lens .
p10861
aVSimply line up the green marks on the lens -LRB- f8 and between 10-20ft -RRB- and almost everything records in pretty darn good focus .
p10862
aVIt has a 2x exposure switch and a self timer .
p10863
aVThis 35mm camera is so small theres no excuse for not always having it with you .
p10864
aVThe price is a little high , but it is a German camera with a German lens .
p10865
aVOn the GTE you set the film speed , this allows for extra exposure compensation control .
p10866
aVThe camera features a 1\u005c/500 sec .

p10868

p10875
aVA few thing that I do n't like were : 1 .
p10876
aVIt should have a removable battery , so that I can replace the battery if I am using it some where and ran out of power .
p10877
aV2 .
p10878
aVIt should have a memory card slot .
p10879
aVHopefully Sony will add these items .
p10880
aa(lp10881
VThis is a wonderful camera .
p10882
aVThat being said , I think I would have had second thoughts of buying it if I had known it was made in China .
p10883
aVThere does n't seem to be any mention of that in the description .
p10884
aVYou would think Panasonic , a Japanese company would be made there .
p10885
aVI love the camera but just wanted folks to know where it was made .
p10886
aVIf `` made in China '' does n't bother you , you will not be disappointed .
p10887
aVWorks nicely with My Mac .

VI purchased this camera for my husband as a Christmas gift .
p10891

p10892
aVTook indoor wedding pictures and even with the flash they were very dark .
p10893
aVTried to salvage some by adjusting brightness on the computer .
p10894
aVLuckily Amazon has a good return policy .
p10895
aVOur new choice is in the mail .
p10896
aVDON ' T BUY THIS CAMERA .
p10897
aVThere is a reason the price was reduced .
p10898
aa(lp10899
VThis camcorder is highly capable .
p10900
aVThe quality of the pictures\u005c/zoom and the features are outstanding .
p10901
aVHowever , instead of buying this camcorder , I purchased the similar TRV-510 .
p10902
aVThe TRV-510 has a color viewfinder rather than the B that comes with the TRV-310 .
p10903
aVEven better , the TRV-510 comes with the ability to take digital stills and save them onto a 2MB memory chip rather than onto tape , and then to download these stills directly into your PC WITHOUT any need to buy a video capture card .
p10904
aVThe TRV-510 is a great way of getting a 640x480 digital camera and a digital camcorder in one device !
p10905
aV The only problem , of course , is that Amazon does n't -LRB- yet -RRB- sell the TRV-510 ...\u000aNN DT JJ NN , IN NN , VBZ IN NNP VBZ RB -LRB- RB -RRB- VB DT NN :\u000a the only problem , of course , be that Amazon do not -lrb- yet -rrb- sell the trv-510 ...\u000a\u000a
p10906
aa(lp10907
VI bought this product just because allows store photos and videos in a SD memory .
p10908
aVNevertheless I must say that the quality of image is very poor even if I formed the camera of the best way and tried it in the best environmental conditions .
p10909
aVThe relation price - quality is acceptable and is very easy to use .
p10910
aa(lp10911
VI have thought about getting into Digital SLR for quite a while .
p10912
aVI used to be a point and shoot user and get hooked on Nikon for their outstanding design and vivid pictures .
p10913
aVStarting from Nikon 3100 , 4600 , eventually a 8700 , I have tried to shoot in various circumstances and tried to convenience myself that a PS camera is good enough .
p10914
aVHowever , I never felt satisfied .
p10915
aVBefore actually purchase the \u005c* 1st , I have also kept an eye on Nikon D70s , Canon Rebel XT , and even D50 .
p10916
aVTried all the models in Circuitcity and BestBuy but did n't feel they were the types I was looking for .
p10917
aVI felt strongly against Canon since their covers and rubs felt cheap and the silver color always remind me of the point and shoot cameras .
p10918
aVI eventually decided to purchase the \u005c* 1st when Pentax offered a $ -LRB- ... -RRB- rebate on the camera body .
p10919
aVThe operatons of the camera is extremely identical to a film SLR camera , and the camera takes in most AF and K mount lens , which actually save a leg while upgrading the system .
p10920
aVI purchased a old lens -LRB- 28-200mm -RRB- from ebay for less than $ -LRB- ... -RRB- and it worked with the \u005c* 1st without any problems .
p10921
aVAnother good thing is the AA batteries used on the camera .
p10922
aVYou can purchase 4 AA rechargable Energizer batteries on Amazon for less than $ -LRB- ... -RRB- .
p10923
aVThe camera fits my hand very well and the original 18-55mm lens came with the camera also meet general photograph needs .
p10924
aVI have no complains with the camera so far .
p10925
aa(lp10926
VI bought these after my son lost my Sightron SIII compact binocs .
p10927
aVMy Sightrons were over $ 300 , and I 'd put the optics on these as equal .
p10928
aVThe color filter really does work to bring out browns\u005c/animals from the greens .
p10929
aVI initially wished I had bought the 8x28 , but the refurb price on the 8x22 was so good I could n't pass them up .
p10930
aVI 'm glad I did n't !
p10931
aVThese definately are for still\u005c/stand hunters , not for someone who will be glassing all day .
p10932
aVDue to eye fatigue , these hunters will need 8x40 or bigger .
p10933
aVThey are also nice to keep in the truck !
p10934
aVEnjoy , and good hunting .
p10935
aa(lp10936
VOk , First of all let me say I have seen a lot of small cameras under $ 200.00 that claim HD 1080p quality video and all of them do not do this resolution really good .
p10937
aVIf your buying a camera of this lower level range do n't expect a great quality 1080p video unless your in bright sunlight and you hold the camera still or use a tripod , just not gonna happen .
p10938
aVIf you want quality 1080p get a high end Panasonic or SONY .
p10939
aVThis camera is wonderful in it 's ergonomics and ease of use .
p10940
aVYou do n't need a manual for anything , it even is equipped with it 's own internal memory so you do n't have to buy a SDHC card .
p10941
aVTaking pictures is easy and the quality is excellent .
p10942
aVTaking video is also as easy but you will have to hold the camera sideways to get the full 16:9 aspect ratio when you view it on the TV or download to the pc .
p10943
aVI have seen people rip SONY for this feature but let me just say get over it .
p10944
aVIt 's not that bad to hold the camera sideways and record video .
p10945
aVIf you did n't like that aspect of the camera then why did you buy it ?
p10946
aVI do n't find it that terrible to use at all .
p10947
aVThe menu system is a piece of cake to navigate through and has a good quality feel .
p10948
aVI also have the Kodak playsport and i like the camera too but this camera quality wise seems a cut above .
p10949
aVThe size of the camera make it look like a phone , very cool I think .
p10950
aVI have resigned myself to keeping resolution to 720p .
p10951
aVI think it looks just as good anyway .
p10952
aVI would recommend this camera to friends definitely .
p10953
aVUpdate 03\u005c/2012 I am still using this camera and I think the HD quality is amazing in good lighting .
p10954
aVI wo n't comment on low lighting but what camera is ?
p10955
aVThe image quality is excellent and i keep going back to this camera to use instead of a few other handhelds I have .
p10956
aVThe Kodak Zx3 is another on i have which i think is also good .
p10957
aVThe video quality i got on a golf vacation weekend was excellent .
p10958
aVUpdate 04\u005c/17\u005c/2012 Upgrading to 5 stars .
p10959
aVThe only complaint on this camera is a lazy autofocus but i upgraded to firmware 1.05 and it works better .
p10960
aVi liked this camera so much i bought another one .
p10961
aa(lp10962
VThis is a great video camera for the price !
p10963
aVI bought that after I broke my old Sony and I 'm glad I broke it !
p10964
aVBecause this camera is smaller , shoots higher quality video , very easy to use and it gets great battery life .
p10965
aVThis is a must buy for anyone looking for a good priced video camera .
p10966
aVI rate it 5 Stars !
p10967
aVYou ca n't go wrong when Consumer Reports rates it # 1 .
p10968
aa(lp10969
VWhen I needed a new camera , I chose this one .
p10970
aVIt was similar to my old one and the price was right .
p10971
aVIt 's smaller and fits in my pocket or purse .
p10972
aa(lp10973
VI love how this camera is so compact but takes great pictures and video .
p10974
aVIt 's so much better than carrying a big bulky camera wherever you go and way better than any picture or video that you can take with a cell phone .
p10975
aVOnly con is that the display is hard to see in the day light .
p10976
aa(lp10977
VThese are an amazing value .
p10978
aVI had high hopes but these exceeded them .
p10979
aVThe optics are clear and bright -LRB- this is based on their price point , yes there are better but not at this price point -RRB- and far outperform the price .
p10980
aVThey are large and a little heavy for small or elderly .
p10981
aVAlso , you need fairly steady hands or a tripod -LRB- mount included yay ! -RRB-
p10982
aV.
p10983
aVYou can also lay down on your back and use them that way which helps steady them .
p10984
aVI am now hooked and looking for my next fix .

aV20x80 here I come !
p10986
aa(lp10987
VI purchased this camera to give to my 6 year old to take pictures on the trip .
p10988
aVAfter reading reviews thought that although light weight it would be perfect for her first big girl camera .
p10989
aVIt was such a HUGE disappointment for both her and I. The buttons did not respond for her when pushed , the camera was difficult to change modes between reviewing pictures , turning on and off , and deleting , and would often get stuck in a mode and the only way to get it out of mode of reviewing or deleting was to open battery compartment to stop power .
p10990
aVat any price this camera was a waste of time !!!!!
p10991

p10993

aa(lp10997
VI picked this up on a whim with a gift certificate I received on my birthday .
p10998
aVWhat a wonderful surprize !
p10999
aVIt gives me wonderfully clear and bright views of the moon even from our light polluted skies here in Southern California .
p11000

VI used to have a sony camera dsc-h3 , I bought this olympus wich was suposed to have some better features -LRB- more resolution and zoom , take panoramic pictures -RRB- .
p11004
aVbut it was a major disapointment : resolution is not good , color of the pictures never looks like the objects you are seeing ; if you use any zoom , pictures get out of focus .
p11005
aVat night , i get blurs or spots on any black thing that I take , I 've tried all the options of lighting but none of them works fine .
p11006
aVThe panoramic picture is a joke .
p11007
aVI was already disapointed , but I got really pissed when last week a friend got a sony dsc-hx100v , that 's a camera , if you have to pay about $ 200 more , it worths it .
p11008
aVyou will regret if you buy this olympus , I read the bad reviews before i got it and ignored them ...
p11009
aa(lp11010
VOn several fronts , this did n't meet my expectations .
p11011
aVThe display quality is far inferior to what I expected - the pictures even on the box had to have been retouched because they were far clearer than anything I saw !
p11012
aVI waited until I had developed two rolls of film using this camera , and was not impressed with the picture quality .
p11013
aVFor close-up pictures , it was not bad - about equal with any other point and shoot .
p11014
aVFor distance pictures , however , I found the quality poor .
p11015
aa(lp11016
VI 've owned a Canon EOS Elan IIe for over two years now .
p11017
aVIn general I 've been pleased with it , but there 's definitely room for improvement .
p11018
aVThings I like : the body is lightweight , the controls are easy to use , and there are some great automatic settings that make it easy to take good shots in a variety of conditions -LRB- action shots , scenery , portraits , etc. -RRB- .
p11019
aVAlso nothing has broken or malfunctioned , which is saying a lot because my camera has been through consistently rough treatment - it gets thrown in a backpack and knocked around quite a bit .

p11021
aVThe auto-focus usually works OK - the view has three small boxes in it , and the camera senses which box you 're looking at and automatically focuses on whatever is in that box .
p11022
aVIn most cases , that 's great .
p11023
aVBut sometimes the auto-focus screws up .
p11024
aVWhen I take a picture of my dog , for instance , it will focus on the tip of his nose instead of his eyes .
p11025
aVSo sometimes I override the auto-focus , but the manual focus is difficult to use because there 's no split-circle indicator to show you when something is in perfect focus .

aVI know , I could have spent thousands on a D2 , but that would have been overkill for me .
p11030
aVSuffice to say , the D200 is a joy to use .
p11031
aVIt is fast , solid , and intuitive .
p11032
aVFor those owners of Nikon film SLRs who are considering a D200 , to me it `` feels '' just like a Nikon film SLR .
p11033
aVI have previously owned several high-end digital point and shoot cameras , and the D200 blows them away in terms of its capabilities , the degree of control it offers , and the resulting quality of the pictures you can take with it .
p11034
aVIt has all the features an advanced amateur photographer could possibly want .
p11035
aVI 'll probably never even scratch the surface of all of its features , but its nice to know they 're there if I want or need them .
